Granted I do believe they are a bit over valued, but at my age and the direction that computation is moving, both of those companies seem like a safe harbor for the next couple decades.\n- 6:30pm - Looks like my tesla has a flat tire, womp! The leak is pretty bad and honestly I feel like crap trying to get it fixed because it will be a pain to just find the right tire shop to do the job. I also have to get my rims fixed a bit, hmm this is just one of those things.\n- 8:17pm - YoRHa UI's object placement and general modal updates need to be addressed. There are a couple ways that I could go about handling this, I am thinking to do my classic build, break and repeat until I get a bit of what I want. I have already written the state management for the modals about five times and counting! Ugh.\n\n\n## Quote\n\n> By oneself is evil done; by oneself is one defiled.

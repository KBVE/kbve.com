This will be an interesting way to see if the CORS issue is specific to the `kbve.com` domain or if its Traefik or if its Cloudflare, ect.. There are a couple different areas where we might be having this CORS issue but this might be the best way to guess and check.\n- 1:26pm - I am thinking of cloning out the YoRHa UI to be a bit like the Aura Idle but I am on the fence because of too many abstract libraries. I might use a 3rd party engine but at the same time, I might just stick with the basic vanilla Javascript as much as I can before I really add more weight to the components.\n- 3:00pm - Taking a side break from the YoRHa UI and now adding Toasts into the KBVE repo. There are two main libraries that I am looking into, Toastify and Svelte-Toast, yet it seems that both get the job done, but I am on the fence on which one that I would use.\n- 4:03pm - Was really hoping the feds would not increase the rates again but I will take a small hike on the table for the remaining year, I guess. Those calls all expired in profit!\n- 5:14pm - Toast looks like its fine for now, needs to be a bit refined but I will have to figure out the best way to do so. I am thinking maybe outside the scope of the current templating system and has it operate as its own component.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Once you choose hope, anything's possible.\n> â€” <cite>Christopher Reeve</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"September : 20","description":"Daily Log for September, 20 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1691335799851-ea2799a51ff0?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-09-20T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

HVAC was not yet done, I am still a bit afraid of getting electrocuted to death.\n- 6:35pm - I am thinking of converting the whole `TypeWriter` concept into a `MangaTextHandler` which will act as the component for all the unique text styles and logos.\n- 8:30pm - Adding a couple more mock examples to the stream tools. Got to top-up the Namecheap.com account as well. Furthermore, I have to prepare another couple thousand for my insurance bill that is coming up too. \n- 11:30pm - As for the 100 assets, I should at least prepare the list and get from the 5 current assets that we are tracking to around 25 before the end of this week. If I can add around 5 assets daily, we should get to the 100 we need to close out the asset expansion issue ticket. After we hit the 100 mark, we can start to organize the data sets for them a bit better, as well as improve the flow of information for each one. Adding a couple of ETFs would make this faster, hmm.\n- EOD - Time to get some sleep. I need to get back to being a bit more active on my journal entries, they have been lackluster these few months.\n\n## Quote\n\n> A monarchy conducted with infinite wisdom and infinite benevolence is the most perfect of all possible governments.\n> â€” <cite>Ezra Stiles</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"July : 12","description":"Daily Log for July, 12 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1686672605288-f83df6f815f7?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-07-12T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

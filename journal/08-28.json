We had to skip a hackathon recently because it felt very unrated and I just did not have the time for it. I suppose doing a couple hackathons back to back is not yet in my timeline, plus my sleep schedule has been taking a hit.  \n- 9:45am - Besides doing my morning trade setup, which includes selling weekly call options, I been thinking that I really need to start expanding out my time table and switch over to a more specific block time. \n- 11:00am - Updating Astro to the latest version! Let us see if we are able to run the `v2.10.14`!\n- 9:35pm - Going to update the repository and make sure that we are able to run Astro at the latest version.\n- 11:17pm - Okay everything was pushed through for this repo.\n\n## Quote\n\n> If you are out to describe the truth, leave elegance to the tailor.\n> â€” <cite>Albert Einstein</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"August : 28","description":"Daily Log for August, 28 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1692364042693-bd5aed6360d3?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-08-28T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

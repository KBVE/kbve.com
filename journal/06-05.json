I will come back to this aspect and update the notes regarding this issue.\n\n- 4:00pm - Going to try the Unity Cloud build and hopefully it will be able to build the application without any major issues.\nI will have to look into how to setup the whole Unity DevOps, but from my basic understanding, it looks pretty straight forward!\nWe might try and have both repos active, one on Github and one of Unity cloud but it might end up becoming a bit too costly to run in the long term.\n\n## Quote\n\n> The person who lives life fully, glowing with life's energy, is the person who lives a successful life.\n> â€” <cite>Daisaku Ikeda</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [X] - Fix the Git LFS / Github build issue with Unity.

{"entry":{"id":"09-26.md","slug":"09-26","body":"\n## Notes\n### 2023\n- 6:23pm  - Over the night I was able to finish up the Helmet integration with the YoRHa UI widget and now I am going to add the footer buttons for the template. I am thinking that the footer should have about just two buttons, one that would be for the version / game data and another for the external services? I do not want to spend too much time trying to figure that out per say and just move forward with the next issue.\n- 9:00pm - The current size of the widget is at around 280kb and I am thinking that I might be able to reduce the size by wrapping the modal into its own internal function and then calling it with children props. This way the size is standard across the board or I could have an action display the modal, which would be also interesting as an approach. \n- 10:51pm - The bundle size has increased to around 290kb, this might become a problem because there are some issues that I am seeing already. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Things do not happen.

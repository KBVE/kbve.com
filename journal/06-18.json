The first concept that I was looking into was getting the basics of the Cloud function LoL Python going and somehow I have turned it into the PyNode project that I was thinking about earlier. While I liked the general feel of flask within Python, it was a bit too slow when I was doing some general stress testing and for that, I am not willing to deal with it. \n- 5:30am - I am thinking for the YouTube functionality, I should extend out the YouTube-Dl from Python, https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl, which I will also reference inside of the Python notes. I noticed there were a couple repos floating around with a large collection of scripts too, something that I might look into in the future.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Anything you really want, you can attain, if you really go after it.\n> â€” <cite>Wayne Dyer</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Add YouTube Download to PyNode\n- [ ] Add League of Legends Champion Information via API","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 18","description":"Daily Log for June, 18 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684029621162-1705b37b51b6?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-18T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

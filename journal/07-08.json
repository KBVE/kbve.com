Coffee, was drank before I even got home. Water? A gallon of filtered water, hopefully there are no PFAS chillin in there. \n- 8:00pm - Going through all of the backlogs and then creating issue tickets for each one! The idea here would be to have about 50-100 issues that are pending, then focus on tackling as many of them as possible. A bit of a wave function style management per say.\n- 11:00pm - I am cycling through almost 200 post-it notes and I am getting even more daily. I have to be very careful not to over extend myself and focus on getting the really basics out of the way.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Act as if what you do makes a difference.

Just chill and do as the gods' will.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"July : 08","description":"Daily Log for July, 08 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1687850109939-a12ec52a3068?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-07-08T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

It was a bit messy but I am thinking that I might just reach out to their support and get it resolved from their end. \n- 3:27pm - Changing the main background color of the KBVE's homepage to a nice black color. I did not change the template's bg-default to the black because I still want to use that blue but keep it a bit higher in the layer, so that it would utilized for certain actions in the future, like the dropdowns. \n- 3:58pm - I am currently looking at this Ai Hackathon and thinking that I might either form a team or look for team mates that might be interested in forming an alliance where we could work on the said projects together! I will reach out to those that might be interested and see if I can find enough people that might be down.\n- 4:05pm - Let me finish up the recovery page for KBVE and then I will shift back to the pocketbase setup. I will create a couple new tickets in reference to the current issues that I want to tackle, so that we can stay organized and make it a bit easier to handle. \n- 4:27pm - It seems that SendGrid is rewriting the URL's with the brandable URL? I am not too sure what this feature is exactly but it is causing some pain points in terms of the usability. I also know that I have only 100 emails per day to send, it would be a shame if I burn through all of those just trying to figure out this mess. \n- 5:49pm - I started to work on the md and mdx structure for different applications and their issues. I will isolate the notes, journals and errors into three basic folders. This will help in the future as we expand the library of information.\n\n## Quote\n\n> If one does not know to which port is sailing, no wind is favorable.\n> â€” <cite>Seneca the Younger</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] LabLab Teams\n- [ ] Pocketbase Notes\n- [ ] KBVE Recovery\n- [ ] KBVE Template Updates","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"August : 13","description":"Daily Log for August, 13 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1626375555783-f5fc7149e03f?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-08-13T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

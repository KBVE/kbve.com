I am surprised how easy it has become with all these new reference points and documents out there, I am actually really content with how an area that is the least serve, has so many improvements xD.\n- 2:01pm - Re-organizing the KBVE.com repo so that it is a bit easier to use in the future, including the part where I would add in abstract functions. I think isolating the Appwrite functions as their own repo was a good initial idea but now I am thinking of combining them all into one and then seeing where we can go from there.\n- 3:47pm - Got most of the Appwrite functions resolved and now I am going to merge the functions into the KBVE.com repo, under the /public/ folder. The plan now will be to build out a bunch of different appwrite functions, then fine-tune train against them all so that we could have our own LLM build appwrite functions? This will be a wild project but I am all for it.\n- 7:32pm - There were some minor changes that I need to do with the repo but for now I am focused on getting the functions operational.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Meditation is the dissolution of thoughts in eternal awareness or Pure consciousness without objectification, knowing without thinking, merging finitude in infinity.\n> â€” <cite>Voltaire</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"September : 18","description":"Daily Log for September, 18 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693483923875-cdd9ef4a8046?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-09-18T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

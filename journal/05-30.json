I am looking to see if I can get into another position on $NVDA , I am looking at $380 puts this week. Furthermore, maybe enter $TSLA at under $190 and $SPY again for under $420.\n- 11:00am - Restructuring the AI cloud functions so that we can encapsulate it all into microservices. We are currently running about 3-5 different instances within KBVE but we could abstract out another 10-20 more 3rd party instances, that are then wrapped inside of the KBVE cloud functions. \n- 3:00pm - Woke up from a nap, going to go install a backup camera onto two of the older cars in my family's fleet. The total install cost for two 7 inch backup cameras comes in at around $400 each, I am trying to see if I can get it down to $700 or maybe work out another deal with the guy.\n- 5:00pm - The shadow magic conch shell is looking better and better! I should throw up a test case for people to see under the official url of [conch](https://kbve.com/tools/conch/). I hope everyone enjoys the absolute memes that this tool will become.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good to be believed.\n> â€” <cite>Ralph Waldo Emerson</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"May : 30","description":"Daily Log for May, 30 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1683576221466-57a1b7a4d608?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-30T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

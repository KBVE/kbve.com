I definitely need something a bit more rewarding or well obtuse, maybe it might be time to hit that cookie clicker flow per say. \n- 12:20pm - Friday! Time to roll some of the TSLA calls/puts out for another week, I have to be careful on how far out I extend them, as I only have a couple thousand dollars to work with. This is okay for the time being as my REITs monthly income has been growing really well this past few months but I want it to grow faster. I should aim for around $10,000 a month within the next 2-3 years.\n- 1:14pm - Going to run a couple quick games of the new Arena game mode on League of Legends aka the `H`. As for the official plans, I believe moving forward we will be naming the game `RentEarth` as we build out the website.\n- 10:54pm - Went through a decent chunk of the backlogs, addressing a couple major concerns and I will have another chunk to add into the current list. There was a Coolify issue that I needed to address, which caused an error in the way we were storing the secrets, but a quick roll back was able to handle that. This does mean that I will have to look over the backup system and maybe implement a whole new one. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Only through our connectedness to others can we really know and enhance the self.

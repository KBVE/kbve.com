I do need to prepare my mornings a bit better, so I am thinking of adding a couple quick ToDos into the mix. \n- 6:01am  - After SSS, I am going to quickly grab some coffee and slowly shift my mind over to the minor development issues that we are running into on the main `kbve.com` repo. \n- 8:18am - Damn it took a bit too long to finally resolve the dev hang! \n- 12:25pm - Going to shift over to the `n8n` and also look over some of the documentation for the hackathon this weekend! I definitely want to make sure that everything is good to go by Thursday night, I am currently taking a bit of a hybrid mixture of notes, some digital and some analog. \n- 1:10pm - I might have to put some constraints on how I will work on the main repo, I believe that while using the mdx files for i18n integration might not be worth it right now. I may have to go back to it later on, in a different date? This part of the project planning and pathway is a bit tough on a developer's standpoint. I see the benefit of using the mdx files for structuring some of the static content but I can also see where the issues can arise, definitely in the scope of certain projects and their styles. \n\n## Quote\n\n> The industrial landscape is already littered with remains of once successful companies that could not adapt their strategic vision to altered conditions of competition.\n> â€” <cite>Ralph Abernathy</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"August : 16","description":"Daily Log for August, 16 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1690320276492-08823be529d1?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-08-16T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

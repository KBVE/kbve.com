I had a bit of a late sleep, if you could even call it that but rather a small nap. I am tired but I am also glad that I got a bit more hands on experience with using Nanostores!\n- 9:00am - Before the market opens, I shall take a bit of time to go through my edge instances and start to update the deployments. There are a couple instances that have not yet been updated since late last year, but they were all docker containers that did not have direct inbound connections, thus I was not too worried about them. Some of the major issues during this process was that there was no auto update and redeploying, even through I had watchtower looking over the instances. The auto-scaling seems to be no longer working but that might have to do with the fact that certain containers were degraded, thus I may have to double check my healthchecks.\n- 11:00am - I am going to rewrite the cloud function of `6479653d74613fd2766e` and create a completely new one! I am going to stick with the default naming culture for now before creating a bit more of an unique structure. Within the timeline, I want to set aside around 10-20 cloud functions that we can execute within KBVE by the end of the year. \n- 3:00pm - Almost had to sell around 400 shares of $TSLA at $215.00 mark, but I extended that mark to next week to $230. Hopefully I can keep the extension going before having to sell shares. Ideally we get a small pull back from the markets but we shall see, that $428 on the SPY is definitely something that I was not expecting. I might try to enter a position in $AAPL next week with a covered put.\n- 7:00pm - I started to build out the automated cloud deployments for my functions but there are still some issues that I need to address. Getting the NET Code and Python deployment out of the way might be the most important thing to tackle this month, so I can start to run those functions within the cloud.\n- 9:00pm - Reviewed and started to take notes on the security within the cloud function deployment, I believe that the final step would be to integration between a payment / credit system and the the deployment of the cloud functions, then we have a full SaaS system!  \n\n## Quote\n\n> The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.\n> — <cite>Henri Bergson</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Start learning more about open runtime.\n- [ ] Create automatic open runtime deployment.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 02","description":"Daily Log for June, 02 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1682965774771-04d7350ae0c2?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-02T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

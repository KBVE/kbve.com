I am hoping that it at least breaks past the $195 mark, so I can offload the shares, but if it does not, then I will keep covering 200 shares until they get sold. My small goal would be to just get in and out for around $200 a week, which I will dump into my $O pool. \n- 2:26pm - Going to install the r3f into the KBVE.com repo, however I feel like it might make the repo a bit too heavy. I shall see what we can do moving forward, there could be a bit better way to handle it. \n- 2:32pm - I will go ahead and install all the libraries that I would want to use for the Three.js integration onto the website and extend out the Canvas via a couple different elements, including a portal and some unique examples. I would like to see how they look under the Unity video game as well.\n\n## Quote\n\n> The conditions of conquest are always easy.

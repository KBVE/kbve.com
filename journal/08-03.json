I am hoping that it at least breaks past the $195 mark, so I can offload the shares, but if it does not, then I will keep covering 200 shares until they get sold. My small goal would be to just get in and out for around $200 a week, which I will dump into my $O pool. \n- 2:26pm - Going to install the r3f into the KBVE.com repo, however I feel like it might make the repo a bit too heavy. I shall see what we can do moving forward, there could be a bit better way to handle it. \n- 2:32pm - I will go ahead and install all the libraries that I would want to use for the Three.js integration onto the website and extend out the Canvas via a couple different elements, including a portal and some unique examples. I would like to see how they look under the Unity video game as well.\n- 2:51pm - We should place the models that we want to use for the R3F inside of the `public/assets/model` and there I will build out some of the general models that we will be using for the test casing. For the time being I will place some of the generic content that I find on the internet there but try my best to keep the licensing within those folders. This will be to help avoid any major issues. \n- 3:20pm - Coffee break and then when I come back, I will begin to install the R3F, I noticed that there might be some issues with how I would want to go about it, so I might have to think a bit about how I would want to handle it. Maybe having an isolated repo for each instance could be better? The Widget style setup would be interesting doe. \n- 6:49pm - Installed the basic libraries for r3f and looking at how they will perform on various browsers. It seems that general mainstream browsers that are are chromium based have a decent ability to render and run the r3f examples. However, it seems that OperaGX was not able to render the portal example at a functional level. I am not too sure if its because I have something disabled OR if OperaGX does not support this type of library. I will have to do a couple more browser test casing, including Safari!\n- 10:33pm - Test casing some of the general r3f libraries. Going to push through a general save state as patch `patch-r3f-install` and then going to continue to work from this branch until tomorrow.\n\n## Quote\n\n> The conditions of conquest are always easy.

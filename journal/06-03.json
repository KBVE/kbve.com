The first thing I might have to do is to double check my server's networking. We spent a decent amount of the late night / early morning going over the different types of networking. The idea was to give local IP addresses to LXC containers but had a bit of a tough time doing so. The big risk with Networking is that it is super confusing unless you have experience and get an understanding of what is actually happening. I honestly rather just let existing software handle this for me, as I consider it all black magic.\n- 4:45pm - Going to sync this repo before I begin to update the whole website to a new theme. The new theme is part of the plan of getting all of KBVE up to date across the board, ideally towards something greater! \n- 7:15pm - I am going to go over a couple popular dashboard themes and see if I can replicate some of their unique functions into the current build of `kbve.com`. I noticed that I do not have the best eslint standards and maybe I should look into addressing those issues and see if I can improve my current setup.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Listen to what you know instead of what you fear.\n> â€” <cite>Richard Bach</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Update Full Website / Migrate to new Flowbite Theme.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 03","description":"Daily Log for June, 03 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1683177920180-0175523b0271?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-03T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

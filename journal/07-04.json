Do not mix BAC with fire.\n\n### 2023\n- 3:30pm - Looking over some of the issues on the main website, there are a couple locations that just do not work as intended. I suppose one of the reasons we are not getting Adsense approval is because of the deadlinks that are splattered across the whole website! \n- 3:50pm - On the sidebar, I will add a media dropdown. The dropdown will be linking to manga, gaming, music and video for now. I went ahead and made it into a Git issue, which I will close out with the next pull request.\n- 8:00pm - Besides the sidebar update, I went ahead and started to update the Search a bit. I am trying to use it more personally but there are a couple things that I also wanted to address and add. One of the things that I might look into would be adding a custom search range that we can save via localStorage and have it insert in every search? This would be an interesting area to explore later down the line. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Miracles come in moments.

The bug is being triggered by two points of interest, it seems to be related to a CORS policy, which is the No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, yet instead of it being a yellow caution, it seems be a red warning. The other issue is that the mouse is not being registered by the frame, so the mouse clicks are not passing through. I believe both of these can be resolved within a week or so, hopefully we can get it resolved sooner so we can move forward. \n- 2:57pm - As I am writing these notes down, I think it would be wise to publish this patch out and then sync the codebase? Hopefully it will not cause any major error, ah shit as I was writing this, I see that there is a merge conflict that is already appearing. Sometimes I do wish working with git would be easier. We need that AI agent to come in and do some general git cherry picking for us.\n- 3:49pm - Okay there are a couple issues that we have to address with how we want to handle the scenes within RJ. I am thinking we would do a couple, maybe around 3-5 scenes within the base scene. As for the mission selection, we will try to display that through the UI/UX.\n- 4:00pm - I suppose the market draw back from the increased rates, maybe we might see more 25bps rate increases throughout the year. \n- 11:06pm - Going to push the generic blog post patch and rotate over to the patch for tomorrow. On my test list, I need to research a bit more about a couple different topics, including `microwave pyrolysis` and how it can be used to recycle plastics.\n\n## Quote\n\n> TV and the Internet are good because they keep stupid people from spending too much time out in public.\n> â€” <cite>Douglas Coupland</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Finish loading the base scene inside of the RJ.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"July : 27","description":"Daily Log for July, 27 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1689071594546-7cbe97a3442e?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-07-27T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

This is great news as it means I can plan my new trip to India a bit better and not have to worry about him being in India with an expired visa. This makes me wonder how my life will be when I am nearly at his age of 80? He is a true warrior, the man has done it all. \n- 3:30pm - I need to start planning the construct and layout for RareIcon, with all these projects in the backlog, I may have to find a better way to manage my time within the scope of error handling? I should utilize more of the error / issues that we have and then target them each over time.  I will postpone anything major for RareIcon until we get RJ onto the Steam store.\n- 9:00pm - Finished organizing the notes and learned a bit more on how to use Mermaid! Moving forward, I will try to use mermaid for all our note taking, as it does make things a bit easier. \n- 9:30pm - Region Save for Dwarf Fortress. I wonder if I could make a repo for the game and then have that saved for people to access and play.\n\n## Quote\n\n> The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches but reveal to them their own.\n> â€” <cite>Benjamin Disraeli</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Finish Up Profile Page\n- [ ] Organize Initial RJ Mangas","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 28","description":"Daily Log for June, 28 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1685980201821-6577f4feec1a?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

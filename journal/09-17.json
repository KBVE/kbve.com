Now I am back on the computer and going to start the micro function migration.\n- 4:45pm - The first function will be the register, which has been somewhat of an issue for a while because I have to make it create the user, profile and the various other components within the structure.\n- 8:21pm - Everything is working to a certain extent, so I am glad that it is moving along! I am getting a better understanding with how Appwrite and Docker are working, its really making things a ton easier as I am getting to understand it.\n- 2:00am - Halo and One Piece?! I am all into this mixture! Best combination, because its really a throw back, I remember playing halo 2 and watching one piece at the same time a decade ago.\n\n## Quote\n\n> A good decision is based on knowledge and not on numbers.\n> â€” <cite>Plato</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"September : 17","description":"Daily Log for September, 17 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1692095296815-943c0e214cd0?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-09-17T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

I am also a bit behind on some of Amazon's newer cloud tech, they keep releasing new stacks and its a bit over kill at this point.\n- 4:00pm - Getting EFS / Elastic File Search to work outside of the Amazon VPC is definitely better now than what it was like in 2016. But know I am looking into the RDS structure once more and it makes more sense that this might just be over engineered. I might just step back and look at a different approach to handling the file system. \n- 7:15pm - Our team did amazing for the Ai Agent hackathon! I am glad that we placed 3rd and I am really excited to see where we go from here, as this might open so many interesting doors that I am not yet ready to expect. On one hand, I do not want to over run myself with any form of ego, but I really think we have an amazing group of developers and the pressure that hackathons bring has a nice touch of anti-procrastination forced into it. Sometimes the competition brings a different level of human nature into the mixture, it creates a sort of excitement and the publicity that comes with it is also a great cherry on top.\n\n## Quote\n\n> When a thing is done, it's done.

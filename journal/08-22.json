{"entry":{"id":"08-22.md","slug":"08-22","body":"\n## Notes\n### 2023\n- 6:34am - My sleep schedule might be a bit off for right now but I will be working on getting it back together within this week. \n- 7:43am - Going to sync the repo with the dev branch and then start to make notes on the mL and Nodepy. To grab the appwrite key, I did a test case to see if I could read the variable. ```javascript\n  router.get(\"/app/app/\", (ctx, next) => {\n  try {\n    _v(`{r} -> app -? ${process.env.KBVE_API}`);\n  }\n  catch (error) {\n    _v(error);\n    ctx.body = {\n      status: 500,\n      message: error,\n    };\n  }\n}); ```\n\n- 7:44am - Let me sync the repo.\n- 7:50am - There were a couple errors with the sync going to fix them up after work.\n- 9:30am - The market looks like a bull trap, honestly I am hoping that the feds do another pause on the rates and keep the slow increase going. \n- 9:33am - Going to clean up some more of my notes and maybe use a bit more of the GPT.\n- 5:32pm - Off of work and now I am going to see if I can push these notes through.\n- 9:25pm - Added charts to the stocks but need to do some more updating and configurations! There are a couple of interesting test cases that we could pivot around and make a bit better for `meme.sh`.\n- 11:16pm - I went through the RentEarth and was able to clone and repo through everything, I should make it into a template in the future but for now this seems to be more than good enough. \n## Quote\n\n> The ultimate promise of technology is to make us master of a world that we command by the push of a button.\n> â€” <cite>Volker Grassmuck</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"August : 22","description":"Daily Log for August, 22 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1692168148018-315b6920a699?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-08-22T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

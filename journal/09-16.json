Now getting the command line to be operational will be the next step, but that might be something that I am willing to wait off on until things are a bit more stable within the eco-system at Appwrite. \n- 7:22pm - Now I need to convert over a couple of the cloud functions for the whole eco-system to the new repo and then do the deployment from there. I have to also test case the backup system and make sure that it works as intended, but that will be worth it before the hackathon.\n\n## Quote\n\n> To give oneself earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.\n> â€” <cite>Confucius</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Get Appwrite Swarm up and running with additional integrations.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"September : 16","description":"Daily Log for September, 16 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693892256532-fa0ee2ffd010?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-09-16T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

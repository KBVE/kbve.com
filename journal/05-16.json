The patients would have tablets, where they would sign forms, fill out and double check their information, schedule and more!\n- 12:00pm - Spent some of the time going through the Unity project. I still need to do some updates here and there with some plugins however they might break the game in other areas. I believe test casing or a system to test case the game might have to be on my agenda down the line.\n- 2:00pm - Quick workout session , some minor chores, damn laundry! \n- 3:00pm - One Piece, league and programming session aka Memegramming! I am trying to rotate out of Shaco and into Senna, but getting the build and learning the play style have been some issues that I wanted to resolve. Found out that Luffy pumps his own blood to get stronger but also shortens his own life.\n- 7:35pm - Read this interesting article about the `Boot Girls` aka [NPR Boot Girls](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176175801/boot-girls-atlanta-private-parking-enforcement) and its an extremely cool concept! Imagine buying a 3D printer and making unique set of keys that can unlock car boots and then selling them?! It reminds me of the blue ocean and its a great start up besides the ethics involved. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Chance is always powerful.

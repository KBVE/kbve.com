Once that blue hue starts to come out, the crows start to feast.\n- 11:00am - Going to have a nice and relax Saturday, a couple quick H sessions and some general chill vibes until later tonight. The main focus will be to prepare the NodeJS / Python cloud function, which I could turn it into a custom cloud function, with automatic build and deployment? \n- 3:00pm - I started a great book from Julian Baggini called `The Duck That Won The Lottery`, I will try to include some cute notes and feedback while I am writing these random journal entries. The preface is legendary, I am already loving the starting quote, `Doing things right is simple: just elimin ate all your mistakes and then you'll be perfect.`! I went to highlight the sentence and ended up over highlighting it? To infuse more grace to the fire, the lofi remix vibe added a layer of poetic justice. I am not even looking to backtrack.\n- 8:00pm - Settling down after a couple league sessions, the first concept will be to migrate out the cloud function from being just a python script into the NodePy setup. The main objective will be to migrate certain key components out of the basic setup, hmm this might be a bit tough to write out. The docker image that I will use is from `nikolaik` , under `nikolaik/python-nodejs:latest` and I believe that it is a Debian-based operating system. Based off the Github, it looks like Node 20 and Python 3.11, which I should not as the target for this image? Or should I keep it to the latest? Hmm... That might have to be a future problem for my future self.\n- \n\n## Quote\n\n> Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.\n> â€” <cite>Mother Teresa</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Deploy a basic hybrid cloud function with a load balancer.

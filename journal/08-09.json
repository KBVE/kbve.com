Going to spend the early morning setting up Supabase and migrating the tri-force to near perfection.\n- 6:24am - SSS Completed. It took some time for my system to boot up because of a Windows update BUT I am all cylinders ready to go! The first couple course of actions would be to setup the Redis cache system, so that we are not hitting the database too hard with our queries. \n- 7:35am - The n8n and Supabase integration will start with the general profile, I should expand it out slowly as I get more information and time to work with it.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Everyone in the world ought to do the things for which he is specially adapted. It is the part of wisdom to recognize what each one of us is best fitted for, and it is the part of education to perfect and utilize such predispositions. Because education can direct and aid nature but can never transform her.\n> â€” <cite>Maria Montessori</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"August : 09","description":"Daily Log for August, 09 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1690035921522-d3a2120f7e4c?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-08-09T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

The idea here will be to isolate as much of the script(s) that I am building and move a certain amount of the logic into cloud functions. I do also want to move certain functions into their own worker threads but that will be something that I can work on later down the line.\n- 1:00pm - It looks like we can continue development of RogueJester but at a limited scale, at least until we get a better understanding of the whole project. Starting Monday, we will begin a month of active but slow development. We will be doing about 3 weeks of development currently but hopefully it is enough to get the whole game to at least beta / demo.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Love yourself first and everything else falls into line.

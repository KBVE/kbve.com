Ugh this was a task that I hate doing because talking to lawyers has always been a pain. \n- 10:33am - I need to redo my gym schedule, I might have to do something a bit more hardcore and maybe do the duel trips? Aim for both a day and night trip, just to get out of the house and get some more data on FSD. \n- 2:30pm - The lag on league of legends is starting to get to me! It just seems to be way too much recently, the spikes are a bit draining. \n- 2:37pm - I will finish up this basic account page and get it functional enough to push to the main branch. \n- 3:06pm - I noticed that I was running out of space on my computer, so I think it might be time to do a bit of quick cleaning. I was at 72gb free and now I am at 134gb free, however I could remove some of the games on my computer but we all know that will not be happening. Cleaned up my downloads folder and now I am at around 170gb free. This should be enough for now, once I tackle my github folder, that will sum up a decent chunk.\n- 9:05pm - The most recent `patch-july-30-2023` patch was a bit too much code, I am going to scale it back to smaller patches, so that there will not be massive changes inside of just one patch.\n\n## Quote\n\n> For it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart.

It looks like Unity was able to build the game, however we still have a couple things that we need to finish up before we could release a working steam demo. One of the core concepts that I was looking into was how we could start the wishlist before throwing together the demo. I should use the word `playbale` lightly, I would say that it does run but most of the crashes are actually just minor bugs and unexpected events, per say.\n- 11:00pm - The new login system has to be setup and we need to get that going within the next couple days, so that players could load into the game without having any major issues. \n\n## Quote\n\n> A single rose can be my garden... a single friend, my world.\n> â€” <cite>Leo Buscaglia</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Complete a windows build.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 06","description":"Daily Log for June, 06 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684334035702-c1fd3dafa74f?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-06T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

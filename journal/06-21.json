I might also get assigned on one of my TSLA calls, but at the same time, my puts look like they expired with a decent amount of profit. Overall this week looks like another $2000 in the bag, which I will most likely allocate towards CEFs, as my REIT position is already above 10% of my portfolio. I might also look into adding a larger position of bonds too, including some meme bonds.\n- 5:00pm - Decided to delete the older manga reference files, including the abstract theme. I am going to start it again but with a fresh take and maybe a more internal / core approach to resolve the issue. As for the transition effects, we could reference the older SWUP but we can also utilize the pre-fetch to help load the options before hand? There are a couple ways we could go about this.\n- 11:00pm - It looks like the basic layout for the manga / visual novel looks like it can be a MVP. I am going to mess around with the settings and see if we can expand upon that.\n\n## Quote\n\n> If you would take, you must first give, this is the beginning of intelligence.\n> â€” <cite>Laozi</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Start Mother-in-Law Construction Research\n- [ ] Manga Codebase Refresh\n- [ ] Start Living Trust Research","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 21","description":"Daily Log for June, 21 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1685110191139-eb2caaac220d?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-21T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

I know that it will have way too much information and no one will really read it but that will be on me to tell them over and over. I want them to memorize it once its completed! Then in a couple years, I will release it under this repo.\n- 5:04pm - Daily chores are out of the way, now I am going to fix up the Docker. \n- 8:56pm - Added loadash to the docker image, I should push that out for now and fix up some of the notes that I would reference.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Where there is love there is life.\n> â€” <cite>Mahatma Gandhi</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"August : 27","description":"Daily Log for August, 27 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1690859577314-ddcd385ee050?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-08-27T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

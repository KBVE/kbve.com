The holy trinity is almost ready to be pushed out to the masses, I suppose the next step will be to test case a couple different instances, including the mobile platform. \n- 1:27am - Played a quick match as Shaco support before he gets that long awaited nerf. Okay we know that the session does not preflight, thus we might not need the cache at the general `getProfile`, I suppose we could rename that function to `getUser` and rename `pullProfile` to the `getProfile`. I was under the impression that the session would query against the Supabase but it does not and utilizes the JWT to get the information, which is what we want it to do anyway. \n- 7:56am - Going through some of the current active tickets and trying to tackle a couple minor problems here and there. I want to reduce the amount of tickets that we have active from the `40` to a mid `20` range by the end of this month!\n- 8:49am - I think I need some early morning caffeine pumped into my blood flow! Before I head over to get some much needed cafe, I am going to take a look at the structure of mdx -> astro, with the hopes of just making it even more stupid simple. Basically going to migrate all of the website into its own internal content style structure and then have it all render through the contents folder? Maybe not all of the content but at least some of the main structures. This might seem a bit too much of a hassle but I think it might be worth it in the long run because then I could isolate each of the components within their own documentation too. All of this is to prepare for the i18n, which will be another beast in its own realm.  \n\n## Quote\n\n> All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.\n> â€” <cite>Walt Disney</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"August : 12","description":"Daily Log for August, 12 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1689850969146-43cd8e188bbf?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-08-12T00:00:00.000Z"}}}

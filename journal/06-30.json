This docker image would run Steam within a Docker instance and let the GPU pass through, so ideally it would make it easier to manage the game instance. I am wondering if I could also automate the connection to the container, maybe using a combination of the Duck DNS and a reverse proxy.\n- 3:30pm - Okay it looks like I am going to close out some of my positions and see if I can extend out my call options on TSLA, SPY and AAPL. \n- 5:30pm - Going to start migrating some of the ansible components into custom shell commands that can operate outside of Ansible, including the usage of Github Actions. This would extend out the CI/CD and it would help prevent vendor lock-in because it seems that Red Hat / IBM are doing some weird things with their open source software. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Some of the best lessons we ever learn are learned from past mistakes.

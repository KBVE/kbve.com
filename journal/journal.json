It was a bit time consuming, about less than 2 hours in total but it was definitely better than having to schedule a bunch of different doctors. Furthermore, since they all work in the same hospital, they could give secondary reviews and be able to cross-pin among different areas of a concern.

Vite is throwing some errors here and there within the rollUp, so I am currently in the process of debugging that. Afterwards, I aim to integrate AppWrite into Svelte, so that it can execute a bit faster than the current React setup. While React is able to get the basics done, there is a bit of a delay between each action, around ~600ms because it has to communicate with the API (from AppWrites end), I am trying to see if I can resolve that , or at least make it less noticeable via the UX/UI end. One of the aspects I was thinking of was to store the user information locally after login, to have an almost instant load WHILE only having `update` and `delete` require a connection/load.\n- `Something went wrong installing the \"sharp\" module` - Sometimes I hate the sharp module with a passion, I am going to wipe the local installation clean and start fresh from the dev branch. \n- Next issue was that Search via the MDX page was throwing some weird errors and honestly I am a bit too tired to figure out why it was giving a pain. I am assuming its because I forgot something to render or messed up the JSX / react syntax, but to make it easier, I decided to migrate it out of the MDX concept and make it its own .astro page. While I wanted to make it all uniformed via MDX template, certain areas might not be worth the time. Furthermore, I disabled the bing / you searches because they were giving errors of CORS on certain browsers.\n- I would say this is a bit of a major update to the website, as I begin to migrate + add more into the framework.\n- Under search, I expanded the options and included `reddit.com` and `stackoverflow.com`. The results are not within the iframe but instead they open in new a window/tab; I will gladly add more options/parameters down the line, including expanding into images and GPT/LLVM.\n- 8:37pm - It seems that my idea of having a general namespace and then running a custom templating system out of that is just a bit too much. I will go with a more simple widget style and just import the widgets directly, instead of having them all over the place. I just get confused and there just so many options and ways to do things... that it just too much. Sometimes I over-engineer everything and it might not be the best, BUT it was dope to have emoji-style templating, even if it was a complete waste of time, rip 50+ hours I spent lmfao. I did learn and gain so much knowledge from the experience, so it might not have been a total waste.\n- 8:40pm - Just saw a dude on a bike get nailed by a tuktuk / rickshaw, he was okay but was driving in the wrong direction and going a bit too fast.

There were no major database migrations but I backed up everything to be safe. \n- Next mission is to upgrade AppWrite from 1.3.1 to 1.3.3 , which I am doing right now. There are some issues that I need to address between the AW and Strapi API, including the unique keys/index. The update seem to work out well and the database migration did not throw any issues.\n- 7:00pm - Refactoring the KBVE.com codebase by removing old / dead astro files that are no longer required. This is to help improve performance and to clean up the workspace, so that others can easily navigate through and not have any issues. There are instances where certain files get referenced twice, once via the Namespace and then again directly via import. \n- I have to restructure the name convention and I believe that keeping it extremely basic will be better in the long term. Thus I think it would make sense to use the term, `Widget` , and place all the `Element` / `Action` into that area and the migrate them out again in v2 of KBVE.com. Mapping out each widget seems to be a waste of time right now, as I keep rotating different file names and file types without keeping something straight forward.\n- Another interesting error that I am having is with the email(s) going into spam. The issue is actually not on my end but rather that our advertisement platform, \"Ezoic\", throwing errors ecause it is unable to proxy the CNAME from our email provider, \"SendGrid\".

I will have to transfer them over to this knowledge bank later this week. There are two core pillars that I have to make sure that I get right for deploying future iOS applications. The first will be getting flutter to actually build and sign the application, so for that I will run `flutter doctor -v` and see what it requires for the iOS / iPhone build. It seems that I will need xCode and CocaPods, it was pretty straight forward for getting the xCode, as I was able to grab it from app store.\n- The CocaPods aka a Swift package manager that Flutter uses for iOS development was easy to install, just had to run `sudo gem install cocoapods` and then agree to the xCode license.\n- The next pillar is the development and pipeline, currently I am able to build the iOS application within the development eco-system. However I will have to figure out how to setup the CI/CD for the application, ideally making it so that once the commit is made on the `main` branch, it will automatically deploy the application to the Apple App store.\n- 3:00pm - Going to prepare to pack up my luggage! It seems that my grandparents have some older suitcases, so I am thinking of letting them have mine, while I go grab some new ones. I am going to travel to either the `CromAs` or `InOrbit` mall and pickup two new suitcases. The total cost was around 15000 Rupees and they were pretty solid hardshell cases, they look and feel like a CSGO crate haha.\n\n## Quote\n\n> If you want your life to be more rewarding, you have to change the way you think.\n> — <cite>Oprah Winfrey</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Install and update xCode / CocoPods.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"May : 04","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-04","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1661948746536-14df44b0ad43?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"05-05.md","slug":"05-05","body":"\n## Notes\n\n### 2023\n\n- 9:30am - Woke up a bit earlier today, got ready and headed out to the border part of Vadodara, known as Gotri. I asked a fellow friend to bring me some Goldbond lotion from America, which my grandparents love and its a bit hard to find here in India. \n- 11:15am - Looking over the `kbve.com` repo and noticed that there needs to be some updates that I have to do for the day. \n- 11:25am - Quick break from travel / coding and going to relax, watch some game trailers and sip some coffee. The Unreal 5 game engine demos have been crazy! I can not wait to test out Unreal when I get back into the states, I will not be diving too deep into that engine, as I am still learning how to master Unity. \n- 12:30pm - I am looking over the CI/CD for the Android deployment. Its been a couple years since I messed around with this, I remember doing it before in Jenkins and again in Gitlab, so I am sure it will be even easier with Github / Git Actions. Later down the line, I will look into doing hybrid deployments, including a combination of private and public repos, to avoid any future issues of licensing / conflict of interests. (i.e if I am using a paid Flutter theme and want to include it inside an open source project! We would host the paid theme inside a private repo and let the open source project pull the code during the build / deploy phase.) Here is an interesting article that goes over what I am looking to [setup](https://dev.to/matijanovosel/deploying-flutter-applications-to-google-play-using-github-actions-j8a).\n- For the releasing, I am going to use the actions from this developer, [Subosito Actions](https://github.com/subosito/flutter-action) , and the two specific ones that I am interested in are the `android` and the `ios`. \n- 2:15pm - I really hate the breaking changes in Flutter! Okay to grab the parameters from the path, you have to call `state.pathParameters['pathId'];` with pathId being the variable that you pass through. In our situation we will only be passing one pathId through-out most of the application. The user-information will be stored inside of the HiveDB for now and I will have it make the net request after pulling the information from HiveDB. So in the case of looking up the stock asset, it will check the local instance of the asset and if it does not find it, then it will make a net request for the updated json from the static kbve.com api. I am thinking if there is no internet, then have the application perform the best it can using the local storage data. Side note, the local storage for the mobile applications will be in their default documents folder or downloads folder.\n- 6:00pm - Okay I am going to remove the deep nest and keep everything at max depth of 1, so that I can streamline everything else into a simple and easy flow. So instead of `asset/stock`, it will be just `stock` or `crypto`. This will be with all content and mainly so that I can keep everything type-safe and organized later down the line without having too many constraints and dead code to deal with. There might be some SEO/SEM impact from the link structure change, but I think its safe to do it right now rather than later down the line. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Trust your hunches.

The first piece of her work that I am going to read while taking this rickshaw is `Winter's King`. \n- 3:00pm - Currently on my last interview for a new job that I might start in June! I am excited but I might also decline because the amount of pay is not worth the amount of work that they might demand. We shall see, I usually enjoy working for startups but seeing how they conduct their interviews and testing has been very off-putting. I might also not get the job because I did decline to sign any NDAs until I felt more confident with the company.\n- 9:00pm - Going to start to integrate Rive into the Flutter application!

Granted this was a shower thought but it would be interesting to develop an AI-based mentor / digital character that would reward for completing certain tasks on time? This could be combined with different pre-built personality language models, so you could have your pet digital monster become aggressive and berate you for not doing pushups? I am just writing my thoughts, hoping that I do not forget them later down the line. The idea is not have a companion that drains your mental health, but rather let you customize it based on your own personal motivational factor(s). I might not find a devil daemon calling me a fat slob for skipping 10 pushups haha but I would not want to impose that onto a younger child, if it were a gamified application.\n- 10:30am - Traveling to the local temple for the last time before I head back to the states, I actually enjoy coming here in the morning because some of the stray dogs come in and its cute to watch them engage with the locals, including them getting treats for being awesome. \n- 12:30pm - Sync the notes. It looks like the pass tool is currently broken, so I am going to try and figure out what I can do to fix it again. I believe the issue might be the way that I am handling the javascript within AstroJS, I will go through some guess and checks and see if I could resolve it that way. It works in `dev` mode but after the SSG, the `generate()` function seems to be missing or broken, so lets see what the issue could be.\n- Error @ 12:30pm: \n  ```javascript\n  (index):166 Uncaught ReferenceError: generate is not defined\n    at HTMLButtonElement.onclick \n```\n- Going to try and push the pipe through `alpha` and then test case it via the Netlify build. Okay, looks like that resolved that issue. I was missing the `is:inline` when calling the 3rd party external scripts, okay going to move back to updating the AppWrite.\n- 1:15pm - Updated AppWrite to 1.3.4, then did a quick database migration! I am wondering if there might be a way to do an update without taking the whole API down but I noticed that it could cause corrupted shards, so I suppose it might be best to keep it the way it is right now. \n- 2:45pm - Getting ready to go shopping around a local mall district. I got over 30kg worth of free space in my luggage, so lets see if I can find anything interesting to buy. Before I head out, I think I will test case some of the local pipelines that I been building, including one that is known as `cook-ai`, which is a small mL model that helps you make amazing recipes! \n- 4:00pm - Looking over all my blueprints that I have written for KBVE and starting to parse through them and organize them into something a bit more meaningful and structured. \n- 5:45pm - Great background video, [The Micro Education Business Model - How To Monetize Your Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgAMayF-JZY)!

Through all of this, it seems that our dear friend, Fudster put me onto a quick quest. It is always interesting to be drugged up by a dentist and then open a bunch of unix terminals to setup a virtual machine. I enjoyed being in the dentist chair, half baked, typing away linux commands. If this was in the US, I am pretty sure the dentist would have violated several ethical boundaries for what I was doing haha.\n- 12:30pm - Going to look over the current backend setup and see what needs to be updated. Overall the system looks healthy with no massive errors in any area. The main operating systems are still up to date, I looked over the unattended update logs and everything seems fine on that end. \n- 5:00pm - Looking at tiles for remodeling the home and bathroom in India! It was interesting to see that electronic upgrades are more costly than doing general service to the house. I suppose it makes sense because labor costs in India are extremely cheap, as there is a large pool of workers. Yet the tech market within India is extremely inflated and it comes mainly from the excessive tariffs that are imposed on imports. \n- 7:00pm - I think its time for me start researching into VCs/Venture again, just going to do some core / basic data gathering. I realized that I could add up to a million contacts onto the HubSpot CRM, so I am going to go through my older emails and reach out to some VC funds and build up an initial cold list. There are two main issues within the VC field that I am seeing, the first is the insane amount of capital going into machine learning / A.I-based startups and the second issue is that the rising interest rates is squeezing and limiting the general funds that they are willing to risk / invest. In addition to the rising rates, the recent bank collapses have also decreased the amount of risk that funds are willing to take.\n- 7:30pm - Going to start a developer environment with a new hybrid cloud setup. I was looking at some of the recent changes with vCluster and I think its right about the best time to do a couple edge test cases from scratch. There will be two phases for this, the first will be doing everything manually and keeping track of the scripts, configurations, ect.. and the second phase will be to use Ansible-Tower to automate the deployment of the whole setup. I do not expect any of this to be successful but I am down to see where I hit failure, last time it was with the storage.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.\n> — <cite>Winston Churchill</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Finalize materials for the house.\n- [x] Migrate rupees from bank balance to fix deposits.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"May : 08","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-08","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1664202526602-08cbc96c4b3c?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"05-09.md","slug":"05-09","body":"\n## Notes\n\n### 2023\n\n- 10:00am - Just had 500mL of cold brewed coffee that was aged in whisky and rum barrels! It might have been a bit too much caffeine to start the day, I feel like my heart trying to escape my body. Besides the overload of energy, the taste was amazing, the hints of whisky and rum notes are noticeable through initial taste and near the end. It blends so well that the exiting bitterness that comes with normal brews is almost gone! Overall it was nice to meet the creators of the brew, however they are still in the experimental stage and have not yet done any social / digital work. I was kindly given some concentrated powder to take back to the US with me, think of it like instant coffee? They said they would reach out if they need any digital work done, but I know that my costs might be too high for them.   \n- 12:30pm - Weighing out both bags, it looks like I have about 20kg of free space, thus I am going to go H.A.M and buy a bunch of shawls and then maybe use the remaining left over weight to grab rare spices that are a bit tough to find in the US.\n- 2:30pm - Went shopping to grab shawls and ended up going to the shop owner's home, we had tea and he talked about his past and how his kids have all moved to the UK/Canada. How I went from buying items at his shop to some how going to his home was probably the weirdest adventure lmao. I needed around 15 shawls and the type that he had in his store were the lighter material, which makes sense because its the warmer season here in India. He told me his winter stock is currently in storage at his home, so we decided it would better if I head over there and look through his inventory. When I got to his home, I was amazed with the amount of stock that he had, the dude could run his own department store from his house! His wife and her family have been hand making some of the styles but lately its been hard for them to stay afloat because of the market has been flooded with cheaper and machine made scarves. I ended up buying a couple hundred dollars worth from him, he was super excited because I basically gave him a couple weeks worth of business in less than two hours. When I am back in the states, I will try to take some cool pictures with them!\n- 5:00pm - Going to take a break from the heat and relax at a new local cafe, man there are a ton of them here, almost every street has a new cafe popping up with their own twists to coffee and tea. This makes sense because the population density is high and there are no major companies that control the sector, i.e think more mom & pop cafe shops and less Starbucks / DD.\n- 6:00pm - Researching on ways to improve the page load of KBVE.com and looking at why some aspects of the website seem to score so low. I might have to remove some of the bulk images that are being loading from UnSplash and remove some of the extra javascript code that we are not using. \n- 6:30pm - Okay it looks like our spell book seems to be causing a painful first page load. I am thinking that might be worth removing the splash component and then seeing how the site performs. The splash is cool but it might not be worth it in the long term, as it might be annoying and a bit of a waste to then scroll down. Speaking of which, I do need to start thinking about how I will handle the content that should be displayed on the front page. We could also remove some of the wait listing and shrink the footer to be more compressed and clean. Overall the changes could easily decrease the total size of KBVE by 10%, across the board.\n\n## Quote\n\n> It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.\n> — <cite>Confucius</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"May : 09","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-09","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1682684112265-e2aa4de8ddc8?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"05-10.md","slug":"05-10","body":"\n## Notes\n\n### 2023\n\n- 10:00am - SSS - *Shiitake, Shower and shave* and out the door! My last official day in India and its giving me the feels. I am going to miss this place for the time being, the society, the flow and the memories. I suppose I will not miss the random cow dung, monkeys throwing dung and the historic slums but the light and darkness create a vibrant eco-system that I can only define as karma. \n- 12:00pm - Going through the general updates for the website, I can not seem to get a basic or static result from the pagespeed tests, they keep throwing me into a random loop of scores. Sometimes I am hitting high 90s and then several sessions later, I am hitting low 60s? I can not tell if its Google or Ezoic (which is displaying Google ads?) or Cloudflare or something that I messed up within my UI/UX. The best course of action might be to just disable everything and then slowly add back content that helps with the flow. Okay lets remove the splash and the general advertisement above the fold! Maybe that might help with the flow of the website and the content. \n- 1:00pm - I removed the splash page, the floating buttons and added aria-labels to the footer buttons. I am going to go through the code base for the main page again and see if I can remove anything else that I will not need for the time being. I will have to update the Oracle component as well and have all the images load at an extremely lazy method, as they are taking a bunch of resources and data up that we do not need to offer. I suppose we could just remove all of the background images for the specific listing and place more gradient style backgrounds with slow loading images upon the hover? We could also swap the idea of a light/dark mode with a slim and heavy mode? Where the website loads with a simple bases and then if they press the heavy, it then takes them to the app. The concept we are going for might be to keep the astro layout as simple and fast as possible! With the visual aesthetics and heavy performance inside of the flutter application. \n- 1:30pm - Upgrading Astro to 2.4.4, Appwrite's Pink library to 0.0.6 RC-12. and the Astro sitemap to 1.3.1. While I am able to upgrade the components and the general website, the cache for the website does not seem to update. I will have to create a new action within Github to clear the Ezoic cache. I could have the cache get cleared via n8n or through AppWrite but I feel like having it done via Github actions would make the most sense. The idea being that we want to put the least amount of stress on our own private systems and offload as much and as many tasks to 3rd party tools and/or applications. The trade off is worth it in the long term, as we expand our collection of websites, we can make sure that the scaling will not hold back our system.\n- 2:00pm - I am trying the cache system again from Ezoic and it seems to be a bit more annoying than I remember. Furthermore, I am having a bit of a tough time clearing the cache, so I will have to look further into how they are handling it. Upon doing some more deep diving, it looks like there might be a conflict with Cloudflare's cache settings and those by Ezoic. We could have a situation where there is a double cache going on, which might make it a bit more painful for the website to be a bit more `live`, as updates might take upwards of 48 hours to dispatch. One solution would be to have some of the more active pages be limited in the cache to just under one hour? Maybe even disable all cache for news and the front page? If we put back up the chat and forum, we could also look into disabling that? These are some thoughts I will go over while I walk around the city before departing. The good news is that there are no issues within flutter, which makes sense because its just a monolithic javascript file aka dart.js that loads everything.  \n- 2:30pm - A great read on how [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/blog/the-service-powering-unsplashs-beautiful-imagery/) handles their backend stack! I love how they organized themselves into a small but productive team, something that I think a lot of startups should take note of. You do not need a massive team to get the job done, just a strong and core collective with simple mission and structure. Granted the initial look at their infrastructure map might seem a bit perplexing but its really simple at the heart. You have an extremely large data set of images and then make it fast enough for the whole world through caching and optimization. I like their take on the newer technological stacks and honestly sometimes it just might not be worth the energy at the time. Why switch your whole database from Postgres to some random new database to only save 10% of speed while breaking all your tools!? It would make more sense to focus the time on growing your business and then going back to re-tool down the line or outsourcing it to battle-proven operations.\n- Ah! Got a new amazing... high, ugh low?... score of 58 on PageSpeed! I guess it might be time to ask the Ezoic team what the fish is going on.\n- 6:00pm - We were able to figure it out! It was a Google advertisement issue that caused multiple issues then stack on top of each other. Actually it was worse but we wont throw them under the bus, because they will never care and honestly its just a shitty and sand thing overall. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Silence is the sleep that nourishes wisdom.\n> — <cite>Francis Bacon</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Get onto a plane.\n- [ ] Tom Hanking around the Terminal.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"May : 10","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-10","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1682553064442-272b63b5a541?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-10T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"05-15.md","slug":"05-15","body":"\n## Notes\n\n### 2023\n\n- 10:00am - Ah! I was assigned to a put call over the weekend and did not realize that I was forced to purchase SPY for $415.00 a share. There might have been in a mistake in the automated hedgefund or a bug because of the timezone change since I came back from India. This means that I will have to go back and go through the codebase to see where I made the mistake. I believe that I might have hardcoded the timezone change, rather than making it a function. I suppose one of the solutions would be to grab the program's IP address, figure out the location from that information and then convert the said location to the right timezone. In addition, have a default config variable for the timezone where the application is running, incase it is under a VPN. \n- 12:00pm - Sent most of the morning doing basic chores and fixing up the MDX files.

I am not too sure if this is a common bug to address, but if it happens again then I guess I will have to make a tutorial about it.\n- 5:00pm - Going through the `Manga` notes right now and there are some issues that I already see on rendering them within Flutter and Astro.

They keep all their records in files and take a rather long time to process their patients. From what I noticed, they could hire an extra person that would slowly transfer over their records to a hybrid-cloud, one where the data is stored locally and within 3rd party data warehouses.

It makes me feel like I'm in a constant state of fog. I can't seem to focus, I'm always tired, and I'm just generally irritable. I've been dealing with jet lag for a few weeks now, and I'm starting to think that it's not just the time change that's making me feel this way. I think it's also my brain.\n  > \n  > As we age, our brains naturally slow down. This can make it more difficult to focus and concentrate, and it can also make us more susceptible to sleep disturbances. Jet lag can exacerbate these problems, making it even harder to get a good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed.\n  > \n  > In addition to the cognitive effects of jet lag, it can also have a negative impact on our mood. When we're sleep-deprived, we're more likely to experience irritability, anxiety, and depression. These symptoms can be even more pronounced in older adults, who are already more likely to experience mood disorders.\n  > \n  > If you're struggling with jet lag, there are a few things you can do to ease the symptoms. First, try to adjust your sleep schedule gradually. This means going to bed and waking up a little bit earlier each day until you're back on your regular schedule. You can also try using light therapy to help regulate your circadian rhythm. Light therapy involves exposing yourself to bright light in the morning and avoiding bright light in the evening.\n  > \n  > If you're still having trouble sleeping, there are a few over-the-counter medications that can help. Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate sleep, and it's available in most drugstores. You can also try taking a warm bath or shower before bed, as this can help relax your muscles and make it easier to fall asleep.\n  > \n  > If you're experiencing severe jet lag or mood disturbances, it's important to talk to your doctor.

I am super excited to see all the dope mods that will be coming out for the game! I will start with Ryujinx first because its on `choco` already and it makes it so much easier to setup and install. I will try and write out a guide, with the help of Bard and Bing? They tend to make things a bit easier, I suppose. Lets ask Bard for help!

Everything is overpriced or really expensive, like the meals are insanely over priced. My normal Starbucks coffee was also way over priced and the amount of calories that I consumed, I understand what it feels like to be an American again. \n- 7:45pm - Time to break down the tasks and see what I should aim to finish up today? I am thinking it might be great to finish up the React-based API project that I was eyeing for a while to wrap up. Oh I got Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom up and running!

In between the research, I will look further into the CSS for the search on KBVE. \n- 4:00pm - Okay, I will break down the search into two areas with the first being the generic CSS flow and the 2nd being the additional variables that help us switch between `Dark` and `Light` mode through TailWindCSS. We were able to override the default CSS that google provided using the `@important` in our `gsc-control.css` but we were not able to extend it out into the advertisement area of the Google search results because those adverts are rendered through an `iframe`. Furthermore, we were able to use the `var(--color-primary)` and a couple other variables as a replacement for some of the key CSS classes. By using the variables, we can then use the light/dark mode feature to switch the theme without having too much of an issue. The initial route we were going to take was to just find hex colors that would suit both themes, but this ended up being the better result. \n- 7:00pm - Now for the `MINA` aspect, I am still looking through all their source / codebase but I found their ability to keep the blockchain at 22KB to be brilliant but I still did not understand how they were able to do so.

The World of Warcraft private server is really great for just taking a solid break and getting into that fantasy brain rot of smashing buttons and eating elves lmfao!\n- 5:00pm - About to head out to car shop for my father because his SUV is about to reach its end of life. It is a bit weird to look at ICE vehicles after operating a Tesla for a couple years but he needs to move cargo around all day and does not feel comfortable yet with an electric mode of transport. I was really hoping that a 500 mile Tesla cyber truck at $40K would be on the market by 2023, but it seems that might be too far away from reality and his car is definitely going to die off before we get a chance to get him that. Our current strategy is find a mid-size SUV that is pre-owned within the past 2-3 years and has a solid history. The main car in our scope is the Acura RDX from 2020-2021 and decided to test drive one of them today. The car is smooth but the kick is a bit slow for me, I am too spoiled with my adult go-kart to even think about going back to this style of driving. \n- 7:00pm - Time to refractor and start the register widget. I am going to go through the repos and servers, doing some general security updates and backups. It looks like my ansible scripts are doing a great job at keeping a rotating cluster of SQL databases, including storing the backups in multiple locations. However the `MongoDB` area is a bit rough, it looks like the backups might have failed, so I guess I will have to spend some time fixing those up tonight. \n- 9:00pm - Going to read up on the patch notes for the new Astro version.\n- 10:00pm - Updating to Astro v2.5.1 and a couple other packages as well for the main website. It looks like most of the updates will not impact our website and the local build was a success, so I will go ahead and push everything all the way up to main.

I was able to grab the Iframe but have yet to apply the custom CSS into that frame but from my understanding that I will not be able to do it because of security issues, i.e the external server is a different domain (since its on Google.com) and the results are on KBVE.com, which would mean cross origin errors. The only other solution I could think of was to just replace the whole search engine when switching from dark / light mode? We could do that within the Search.jsx file and by checking the localStorage for the current skin settings. This might be the only optimal path or finding a color scheme that would match both the dark and light mode theme. I do like the idea of not having the ads blend too much into the search content, but rather make it known that these X ,Y and Zed results are a form of Advertisement. As for the usage of the engine? We are already hitting around 100-200 pageviews/searches per day as of right now but I am sure as we add more features and concepts, it could grow into something a bit more unique for a certain type of people. One of the extensions within the search that I been looking into was trying to remove the bias weights that google assigns to each user when conducting a search. The goal of that concept was to aim at having similar results across different accounts within the same region. \n- 2:50pm - Need to prepare myself to do some lawn care, so I think it be wise to take a quick break from the general flow of programming and get some generic exercise.

The premium for it all was around $1000 that I will collect for this trade, which I do not need right now, so I am going to put them all into $O, which ended up being around 16 shares. Those 16 shares will now make about $4.08? a month in dividends and if I include the cover on the $[O](https://kbve.com/stock/o) shares, then its closer to around $4.25 a month.

The rancher desktop had changed my default WSL settings to its own ubuntu instance, which had caused issues when docker was looking for its own instance. The solution was to remove rancher and all instances of WSL, then re-install [docker](https://kbve.com/application/docker) again.\n- 6:00pm - It looks like coolify does not automatically deploy the newest updates, thus I will have to find a way to setup an automated deployment or see if there is a custom plugin out there that could do it for me. \n- 9:00pm - Taking a break, playing some league and watching Barry!

This means either the OCR software is a bit outdated or maybe I need to create an All in One / AiO type setup.

This is still a creative way to doing the journal, but I wanted to add my own twist and turns into the mix.\n- 3:45pm - @h0lybyte Another concept that came to my mind was adding a bit of a visual novel abstract layer to each of the entries. So that instead of reading them all as a boring webpage, I could extend it out into its own unique journal. The only logical step afterwards would be to hide prizes, gifts and concepts into the journal entries for the fans/viewers.\n\n\n## Quote\n\n> The more light you allow within you, the brighter the world you live in will be.\n> — <cite>Shakti Gawain</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Restructure Unity login API.\n- [ ] Rebuild the journal entry format.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"May : 25","description":"Daily Log for 2023-05-25","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684482570533-b97679dd0705?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-05-25T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"05-26.md","slug":"05-26","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- The time stamps are a bit messy for this note because there were a couple failures during the migration to the newer journal system. \n- The Asynchronous loading seems to be working fine within our first test case inside of Unity but it automatically replaces the cut scene window.

After around 20-30 tools, I will go back and organize the tool page to be a bit more straight forward, including categories for developers, webmasters, gamers and memers.\n- 1:00pm - Expanded the Coolify and Portainer storage on the main dedicated server because we were running out of space, I am so grateful for the [LVM](https://kbve.com/application/lvm) notes for reminding me how easy it is. The next step might be to create an ansible script that will automatically check the file size for each instance and then make a judgement call to expand the storage. \n- 8:00pm - Listening to Fudster is exactly like injecting cancer cells into my brain. The more you listen, the faster the stages evolve. \n- 9:00pm - Finally got the shiv updated and I have all of the puppeteer running under an asynchronous factory. Now I am going to add JWT authentication and then we should be good to go with building out a basic SaaS-style tool! I will initially make the tool free for users and then add a credit system later down the line.

One of the ideas I was having for it was to integrate a basic GPT into the questions that the user types into the application? So it combines the audio return of yes / no but also gives you a GPT generated response via the typewriter effect. Its a bit tough to describe the product, as I can already see how to build it out within my head. Putting the pieces together will be the focus.\n- 4:00pm - Quick league matches with the homies, doing some chores and then going back to updating some of the applications. \n- 5:00pm - One of the things that has been stopping the puppeteer from scraping is anti-bot protections that websites have. So I am thinking of ways of going around it, not for any other reason but science. Within the industry, this is known as the Cat and Mouse game, where developers on both, red and blue teams, are trying to beat each other. \n- 9:30pm - Going to see if I can get a mock version of the magic conch shell up and running!

I am tired but I am also glad that I got a bit more hands on experience with using Nanostores!\n- 9:00am - Before the market opens, I shall take a bit of time to go through my edge instances and start to update the deployments. There are a couple instances that have not yet been updated since late last year, but they were all docker containers that did not have direct inbound connections, thus I was not too worried about them. Some of the major issues during this process was that there was no auto update and redeploying, even through I had watchtower looking over the instances. The auto-scaling seems to be no longer working but that might have to do with the fact that certain containers were degraded, thus I may have to double check my healthchecks.\n- 11:00am - I am going to rewrite the cloud function of `6479653d74613fd2766e` and create a completely new one!

The idea was to give local IP addresses to LXC containers but had a bit of a tough time doing so. The big risk with Networking is that it is super confusing unless you have experience and get an understanding of what is actually happening.

While the application, Rancher, was great at helping me resolve some of my storage issues, it seems that I will not be using them in production, as they seem to be causing conflicts with Portainer and Docker Swarm.

In this situation, I am extending my grandpa's visa because he recently got some medical work done and is not really suited for travel yet. In my request for the extension, I included the most recent medical report and a couple professional-style letters requesting for an extension, including one from a doctor here in the US and a doctor that is from a popular local hospital in India. I figured if I could reference enough people and have a surplus of documents, they would have a bit harder time declining his extension. The goal would be to do this while getting his OCI resolved, so that we will never have to do this visa meme stuff again. \n\n## Quote\n\n> In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.\n> — <cite>Carl Jung</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Finish Balance Sheet for June and July 2023.\n- [x] Finish Grandpa's VISA extension.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 07","description":"Daily Log for June, 07 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684770683649-9b2d74fa5554?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-07T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"06-08.md","slug":"06-08","body":"\n## Notes\n\n### 2023\n\n- 8:00am - No morning work out today, I feel a bit tired and burnt out from the vast amount of smoke coming from the wild fire.

The only downside that I could see with the car would be the charging, as I would run into issues with the battery draining too fast. \n- 4:00pm - Hope that TSLA does not stay above $230 a share or I will have to perform some spicy memes magic to get over that bump. The price point per share seems to be a bit too much for my type of budget but we shall see as the markets have been eating up all the good news. War? Inflation? Memes? We shall see tomorrow how far the rally will go!\n- 4:15pm - Going to grab some more coffee, caffeine and switch over to some programming!\n- 5:20pm - Okay we got some feedback on the conch shell, there are a couple things we could do to improve it, including adding a button that is an action to `ask` the shell, incase they can not click the shell itself. \n- 5:39pm - Watching Ziggy play shadow of the colossus gave me some old school flash backs! This was such an amazing game back in the day, definitely up there with Zelda, at least for my childhood memories.\n- 6:00pm - Okay I really need to play some music and the fact that I can not find a solid music bot that plays YouTube videos is getting a bit annoying. So it might be time for me to build one really quick to get the job done!\n- 6:30pm - Updated Appwrite to the latest version 1.3.7 and did a basic migration to make sure that everything is okay.\n- 8:00pm - Time to fork over this music bot written in Go and quickly spin up a YT ready bot for Discord. \n- 11:59pm - EoD - Will push some tasks out for tomorrow, learning the different Go aspects was cool but will just end up using Python.\n## Quote\n\n> Imagination is more important than knowledge.

I am thinking that it will most likely be a private bot service, offering very specific and hybrid source bots for the servers. I will do a couple more test cases before launching it out in the future, it is also a bit late in the night for me.\n- 3:50am - The Discord Red bot in python seems to be good enough for what we are doing, it is running under python 3.11, which is good for the long term. I will most likely keep the bot as the core and then extend out private cogs that run inside of the bot, which would be one of the reasons that people would use our service, per say.\n- 4:30am - I was reading up on the recent changes on the Reddit API, it is a shame to see one of my favorite websites slowly fade into the depths of destruction. However there might be a silver lining in this, as more alternatives become popular, the resurgence of older forums, unique communities, decentralized projects, ect.. It will be interesting to see how this comes around when I read this passage a couple years into the future.\n- EOD - I did not keep too many notes for the day, as the lack of sleep threw me into a bit of a slow turtle mode. I am a bit sad that I will have to sell a couple hundred shares of $TSLA at $230 mark because of an of assigned weekly cover call. However it is not too bad of a deal, as I will most likely just write covered cash puts to generate capital from that point of view.\n\n## Quote\n\n> Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again.\n> — <cite>Joseph Campbell</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Make sure not all $TSLA stock get sold at $230! xD.\n- [ ] Unity Async Loader.\n- [ ] React Form Update.\n- [ ] Unity Login Migration.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 09","description":"Daily Log for June, 09 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1685052392951-4eb54985d3ae?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-09T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"06-10.md","slug":"06-10","body":"\n## Notes\n\n## 2023\n\n- 12:30pm - Going over the login screen for KBVE, it looks like I am almost done! This was something that should have been really quick but I had to sit through and understand the whole OAuth situation, as we switched APIs. Now the whole setup is cleaner and easier to use! We can add and remove the components with just a couple quick lines and for the most part, everything seems to be on point! \n- 1:40pm - The login with Github looks like it is working fine! I think we can move forward with the Login with Discord next. Afterwards I will double check what we need to finish up the Google and Twitch. Moving past the basic authentication, then its the Profile page. We will keep the objective for the profile page to a narrow scope before extending it out further. The key components that we could focus on would be the general information and vibe the profile page should produce, something unique and creative but not over loading the browser.\n- 2:30pm - Time for a quick coffee break! One of the other aspects that I was looking into was extending out the different page layouts, including starting the `blog.astro` and adding a couple unique blog articles onto our website. I also did postpone the webmaster tool for a bit too long, so I should look over that and get it going too! \n- 2:45pm - It is interesting to see how Google OAuth2 does its integration, they seem to be very protective of it, which makes sense to me because they have a large scope and can be a target for various malpractice. We started with a test application and now are moving towards production, in this situation we would have to provider a lot of extra information that I did not expect. I am wondering if Google really needs me to create a YouTube video that shows why we need their login support?\n- 3:34pm - Yes! It looks like we are finally done with the basic production ready login screen. There are a couple CSS issues that I see, like the buttons not being exactly in the center? But I can address the style sheet problems later on, near the end. We got Github, Discord, Google and Twitch to be functional and operational! Now we can move straight forward with the next step, which is the profile.\n- 4:20pm - Currently looking around for some unique profile templates to base our KBVE one off of. While I was doing some generic research into the topic, I came across the million.js library, maybe we could add this into the KBVE repo? I am going to do a bit more research into how to integrate this library into Astro.\n- 6:30pm - Upgraded Astro.js to the latest version of 2.6.3 and decided to add Million.js into the project! This might help with improving the load time for complex react scripts. I will keep the integration of `Million.js` to a limit because it is a younger library and there might be issues down the line. This reminds me of the Preact <-> React situation, where certain components failed to render because of the dependencies. \n- 9:45pm - Having a nice salad for dinner, about to hit 40 range on the pure and the profile page is coming out pretty cute! Its going to be a long night of programming and test casing, but I am thinking that it will be amazing!\n\n## Quote\n\n> Love demands infinitely less than friendship.\n> — <cite>George Jean Nathan</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Add Discord Login\n- [x] Add Google Login\n- [x] Add Github Login\n- [ ] Add Twitch Login\n- [ ] Prepare for Nephews Birthday Party","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 10","description":"Daily Log for June, 10 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1683369538180-e9cda27d5463?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-10T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"06-11.md","slug":"06-11","body":"\n## Notes\n\n### 2023\n\n- 11:00am - Just got ready!

I ended up exiting 600 shares and plan to transfer the move to another brokerage. \n- 5:00pm - It seems that my grandpa's visa for India has some issues, so I shall try and resolve the issue as fast as I can. The documents requested are as following:\n\t- Medical Certificate\n\t- Request Letter\n\t- Undertaking Letter\n\t- Travel Document\n\t- Certificate\n\t- Minor Document\n\t- Visa\n\t- Others*\n- 5:45pm - I should further breakdown the different components but there are some additional steps that need to be done.\n\t- `Photo and Document(s) upload are mandatory`.\n\t\t- There are a couple file formats that they support, it seems to be mainly PDF and JPEG.\n\t- `Applicant must upload the photo before proceeding for appointment. `\n\t\t- We will schedule the appoint within the city of Vadodara\n\t- `Size of PDF document must be less than 200KB`\n\t- `Photo Requirements:` which extends into `Format - JPEG, Size: Minimum 10 KB and Maximum 1 MB.` They go further into detail about how the photo should be a passport photo with a  `white background` with no cropping / shadows.\n- 5:55pm - Quickly made a salad before I start to dive deeper into the full requirements. I will start with the `Medical Certificate`, which we already have, its in PDF format and is a total collection of all my grandpa's recent hospital checkups and doctor feedback. I think this collection should be enough under this requirement. \n- 6:00pm - Next, I will tackle both of the letters, `Request` and `Undertaking`, by quickly looking up examples from the Internet. It is a shame that the Reddit blackouts are making it a bit more painful to search through, I had to resort to looking at the cache / older screenshots, but I suppose that means their protest method is definitely working. I was able to find this amazing website, [Indian E Visa](https://indiaevisas.org/indian-visa-extension-online-application/) that provides the perfect set of examples and samples to help navigate through this process. \n- 6:15pm - Example of the Undertaking letter that I written:\n\t- `**I, Mr. Holy Byte, grandson of, Mr. Grandpa Byte, want to inform you about my grandfather holding passport No: 420696969. I am taking full responsibility for my father while he is recovering in India because of his current medical status. Thus, I am requesting immigration of India to approve his Indian entry tourist visa for 6 months.**`\n\t- I kept it straight forward and simple for now, as I do not think this will require much information/detail.\n- 6:30pm - Next requirement was the `Travel Document`, which might be a bit confusing for me. I am under the impression that it is the Passport and/or plane ticket. I will email one of the tourist companies that I know and see what they say. Maybe it might be under the Form C? I guess I will have to look further into that area as well, I filled out this form earlier last week but I will do it again just to be safe.\n- 6:40pm - Following that requirement is the Certificate, which I am going to assume falls under the Medical request / documents, in our situation, thus I will skip this as well as the minor document request. Finally the last remaining seems to be Visa and Others, thus it might be best to include any additional documents that I have within that relation. The specific office that we would be reporting to is the FRRO Ahmedabad, which is located `- Barrack No. 2, First Floor, Govt. Polytechnic Campus, Ambawadi, Ahmedabad,Gujarat-380015`. I never thought I would have to tell someone to visit a barrack within the polytechnic campus in real life but here we are.\n- 9:50pm - Added an additional undertaking letter from my uncle. Hopefully these are enough documents to get this process going. I already emailed the Embassy and reached out to a local tourism agency for further support. \n- 10:00pm - I forgot that someone, *cough*, made a script that automatically enters into class action lawsuits. Anyhow, that script is still running and someone may have gotten a recent check from that script. that person should make it into a weird side project / script for the future reference. Regardless there was a check from the `Celsius Class Action Settlement` and it was for an amazing total of $0.94! WoW!\n- 10:25pm - The new windows server is up and running but there are a couple issues that I am already running into. The first being that docker is extremely slow and I am not too sure why! I really do not want to spend the time to figure out, it might be something to do with the drivers but the amount of time that I would have to spend is starting to look a bit tiring.

I blew through the first couple episodes without even realizing it.\n- 11:00am - Going to take a nap for a while, I been up all night programming.\n- 2:00pm - Decided to take a quick break and visit a car dealership for my mom's new car. We are looking at a 2021 or newer model of an Acura MDX. The current price point is around $48,000 for their `Tech` package. Personally I would want them to switch over to electric but they are still on the fence with it. The 2024 models that we want have a mild waiting period of about 4 months and pre-owned that are certified are around $41,000. I am going to continue to search through different offers, I might just offer around $35,000 and see if they have anything within their system that fits the price point. I will take a model with a couple thousand miles on it, if I can get it at a decent rate. \n- 4:30pm - Looks like my SPY put has expired and my TSLA puts are going to expire as well. I am thinking of rolling them into next week and collect that $1000~ premium. I might also sell another couple cover calls on TSLA going into next week, if this run continues.\n- 5:00pm - Going to get a bit deeper into the development cycle of RogueJester, but I am definitely feeling a bit of project overload already. I might have to switch up my work station and maybe migrate over to a coffee shop or café. A part of me is thinking of just driving to the beach and working from a boardwalk for a couple hours. \n- 5:30pm - Appwrite Integration has replaced the Strapi Integration! Now I am going to test case some basic examples and see if I can play. One of the issues that I am currently facing is the Coroutine / Asynchronous problem but there are enough reference points to resolve it. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Truth is powerful and it prevails.\n> — <cite>Sojourner Truth</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 13","description":"Daily Log for June, 13 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684331441167-4aeafe9edf2b?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-13T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"06-14.md","slug":"06-14","body":"\n## Notes\n\n- 6:00am - Rise and Shine!

I need to figure out what type of insurance she has through Medicare? I am taking on this task as a test case / edge case for future problems that I might have to deal with. The queue is way too long, the hold music is painful and it feels like torture when calling Medicare aka the `1-800-633-4227`. \n- 3:30pm - Turns out that we need to find her comprehensive supplemental insurance through the private market. This type of insurance would cover the 20% of the medical bill that Medicare does not cover, but there is a monthly cost for this type of private insurance. I will have to go through the existing providers and see which one would be the best for her.\n- 6:40pm - Updated the OneJS and Heathen SteamWorks into the dev-holy branch, now I am going to chill out and play some sessions of League.\n- 9:30pm - Did a bit of cleaning, removed a decent amount of bulk waste from the shed, basement and the guest room.

The docker image that I will use is from `nikolaik` , under `nikolaik/python-nodejs:latest` and I believe that it is a Debian-based operating system.

I started to update some of the unity projects and just did my first plastic merge. It was a bit scary, as I hate when I accidently do a rebase or something terrible lol. There were a couple issues that I ran into when merging the main branch into my dev branch. I believe I should have went the other direction but in the future we want to make sure that the main branch is functional before we put any changes onto it. We should also limit the off branch changes to a couple days, so that we are not stuck in a huge problem where the branch forks are really offset. \n- 4:20pm - Making quick plans for dinner! The craving for El Portal is real, I am dreaming about the Mexican restaurant! If you are ever in North Jersey, this is one of the best places to grab food, even if you are vegan. \n- 4:30pm - Updated Gena but it looks like the Unity main branch has a couple broken files. The HealthManager seems to be causing the project to load into Safe Mode. I will take a day break from Unity and switch back over to the main website, I am opening up the Postboy and Manga side projects for the website. I also noticed that the webmaster tools needs to be updated. The best option that I am seeing right now might be to just convert the older code base into the general tailwindcss and then migrate the typewriter effect into the react library, where I can reference it from there.\n- 6:30pm - El Portal with the homies, once I get back, I will make a decision on the the future of the Manga and how I should move forward with it.\n- 11:30pm - After testing a couple concepts out, I think having a MDX file for each page and then letting the writer(s) pick and choose options to display might be the best bet. This would help offset any future SEO issues and also give us the flexibility to add our own custom content, including videos! The big issue that I ran into was if we wanted to do a build-your-own path for the visual novel. The complex index system would be a bit more tough to do within React.\n\n## Quote\n\n> If I know what love is, it is because of you.\n> — <cite>Hermann Hesse</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] Update Taxes, including the Annual Forms.\n- [x] Start Mother-in-Law Construction Research -> Moved Task.\n- [x] Start Living Trust Research -> Moved Task.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 20","description":"Daily Log for June, 20 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1685052386750-902a081b99da?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-20T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"06-21.md","slug":"06-21","body":"\n## Notes\n\n### 2023\n- 8:30am - It seems that I was assigned again on a SPY put, so forced to buy 100 shares of $SPY.

Overall this week looks like another $2000 in the bag, which I will most likely allocate towards CEFs, as my REIT position is already above 10% of my portfolio. I might also look into adding a larger position of bonds too, including some meme bonds.\n- 5:00pm - Decided to delete the older manga reference files, including the abstract theme. I am going to start it again but with a fresh take and maybe a more internal / core approach to resolve the issue.

I will have to make sure that I attend every meeting for the next couple months, it was a bit rough to adjust my sleep and schedule for the meetings but that is no real excuse. I can be caught into a various reasons for my procrastination. What should I do? Well I was able to re-arrange my tasks and maybe look into postponing certain non-important tasks to a later date. I might try to use another layer of numbering or just be honest within my soul, time to put some projects to stale. \n- 7:30pm - I updated the repository for RogueJester and removed my older branch. One of the concepts that I was thinking of was keeping the patches to a limited amount, maybe just one or two max. This way I do not have to keep going back and forth, plus keeps me focused on what needs to be done. \n- 8:00pm - When the application launches, I am thinking of having the basic manga open up and let the reader go through it. This part of the launcher could focus on the notes and latest updates? I suppose we could also sneak in this journal, a bit of offsetting but it could be an idea that we could look into later down the line.\n## Quote\n\n> Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action.\n> — <cite>Walter Inglis Anderson</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Render the Manga on the Unity Project\n- [x] Cleaning up the Unity Branches","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 23","description":"Daily Log for June, 23 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1684906010835-78fd41118654?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-23T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"06-25.md","slug":"06-25","body":"\n## Notes\n\n### 2023\n\n- 4:30pm - Updates to the WebMaster tool.

Going to focus most of the day on resolving the Steam issues for Unity and looking to optimize the load scenes. I am hoping to make the shift between different scenes a bit faster and add a bit of an aesthetic to it as well. I will not be doing this all from scratch but rather looking through existing references, so that I do not get too lost in the sauce.\n- 11:00am - Currently sitting through a quick RJ meeting and going through a lot of the older issue tickets. After spending some time on the Unity project, it would make sense for me to review through the issues that are currently open on KBVE.com and see what progress I can make with each one. \n- 12:30pm - Reviewing over the humble bundle, I did notice that we forgot to add the notes onto our website. We could make a section for deals? Then under the deals, we could keep a track record / log of anything worth wild that we can share in the future. The concept or idea behind a deals section would be something that we can talk about in a future casual meeting.\n- 3:00pm - Watching TSLA correct itself for the short term is interesting, from almost hitting the $270 mark to slowly going back down to the $250 mark. I do have 3 puts for this week on $TSLA at @ $250.00 , which means I will most likely be assigned another 300 shares for $75K. If it does happen, I will just sell another set of weekly call options against them. I was assigned on SPY about 3 times, so I do have about 300 shares of SPY at around 440 mark that I do need to get rid, to shore up some of the cash reserves. I believe a couple loses might mean that I need to take a break from the cover puts and look into riding out a couple weeks. I might need a couple more paychecks to bring my cash reserve back up to a level that I would feel a bit more comfortable, as of right now I have only about $110K cash, with $75K set aside for the put. This is the dangerous part because in this market, you do not want to go into margin, as the interest rate will eat away at your profits. I suppose this could give me the motivation to get that extra jay jawn faster, as one of my goals for 2023 was to have a liquid cash pool of $200K. Since it is already been half the year, it would make sense that I shift focus and resolve that issue.\n- 5:00pm - Need to plan a quick trip for Coffee, Red Bulls and Seltzer. These are my three core powerups and probably what keeps me going, aside for any additional matter-based intake. \n- 7:00pm - I am looking over the notes for our meeting and realized that I would need to look further into the currency concept for RJ and KBVE as a whole. This has been something that we ran in the past and an issue that would have to be resolved before anything major, such as offering a SaaS style system in the future? The current notes that I have would be more towards a 3 tier style system, where I talked about using `KHASH`, `CREDD` and `COUPON` as the terms to define them. When I was talking to a local investor, she was extremely fond of the coupon style concept but was on the fence about the khash and credd, yet from asking a couple developers, they found the khash and credd style to be a bit more forward and the coupon style to be a bit lack luster. I suppose I will have to think it through before I move forward, given that a decent amount of my side wealth may be attached to the internal cogs of this system. I am usually not a fan of placing my own capital at a large risk, as it could hurt the existing projects, thus looping back, maybe it makes sense to stock pile a larger capital reserve. This would mean that we start cutting down in expenses as soon as possible. I guess the homework for this week would be to review all my current costs and see where I can cut expenses as fast as I can, then at the same time, look at places and areas where I can generate more capital? It does sound simple when I write it down, but it can become an extremely painful and dull process within the larger scope. Yet it is always better to do it now, when we have a health budget. \n\n## Quote\n\n> They can conquer who believe they can.\n> — <cite>Virgil</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] - Clean Washing Machine\n- [x] - Allocate 3 hours of R&D on the Unity Project\n- [ ] - Resolve Branch Merging - I will skip this task for the day.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"June : 26","description":"Daily Log for June, 26 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1686397140735-277d8868c76b?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-06-26T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"06-27.md","slug":"06-27","body":"\n## Notes\n\n### 2023\n- 1:00am - Looking over the webmaster tools and seeing what I could to improve upon them!

I am thinking that I might also build out a general template / concept for a majority of my websites as I prepare for my Resume / CV builder. I should aim for about 3-5 live projects that I can shift through and utilize! One of the core concepts that I want to test is the multi-tenant core within the Appwrite eco-system and how far I can extend out the API.\n- 10:00pm - Okay! After some general test casing and going through some templating issues, I was able to get the CI/CD done for RareIcon! Now we are operating the website on NextJS, similar to the Discord.sh setup. My plan moving forward will be to get at least both of those websites to become integrated with the Appwrite. While that is going on, I wanted to start focusing on the `batchmation` of SEO/SEM/Marketing/Media through cloud functions. This part of the project will be a bit interesting to build out because there are a couple moving parts that I need to address. \n- 10:20pm - I believe one area of difference between the Discord.sh and RareIcon.com will be the CSS, I am going to keep Discord.sh with MUI and try Tailwindcss for RareIcon. As for the majority of the notes, I am thinking of writing them out here, as a collection of my thoughts and then clear them up and migrate them over to the documentation.\n- 10:45pm - The Robot Unicorn Attack SWF will be located here -> `https://rareicon.com/assets/swf/arcade/robotunicornattack/robotunicornattack.swf`. I am thinking how I should do the asset structure for the website. \n- 11:50pm - Okay ended up getting it resolved! Let us try this now in production?\n\n## Quote\n\n> What is new in the world?

My general go to breakfast is some egg-form sandwich, coffee and sugar free red bulls!\n- 10:00am - Looks like a minor update came out for Astro! Going to read through that and then update the website. I am thinking I might also go back and migrate the RareIcon.com website from the general node package manager to yarn.\n- 11:25am - Saving the minor updates to RareIcon.com, I need to extend out the general typescript paths and condense the components into a smaller form factor that I can reference easier. I believe that pathing / dynamic routing will be next on the update sheet!\n- 11:27am - The next couple hours I will begin looking back at the Unity async loading problem and see if I can figure out a better way to load the components. The next step was to use vContainers with unitask, so that the loading would be a bit faster between the scenes.\n- 2:30pm - Got the basic of the stream up and running! It has been such a long time since I had it online, I think it will be a solid edition to have within the KBVE eco-system. I will try to live stream my coding sessions more often.\n- 4:45pm - Setting up the Vuplex javascript library on KBVE.com, so that we can reference it inside of Unity. The current plan is to use a JWT session between the Vuplex instance and the Unity instance, but that can change later down the line, depending on how we move forward with it. \n- 5:30pm - Going to make some issue statements regrading on-going errors, updates or concerns with the stream. This might be a good way to keep things organized, so that we can keep everything organized and not all over the place. \n- 10:00pm - Before I forget, I have to create an issue ticket regarding the notification system. We will want to extend this out to RJ and our future games, as well as the future websites that we build.\n- 11:50pm / EOD - `This follow passage was from the hand written notes, doing my best to write it out and save it for future reference.` Making a large list of the functions and concepts that we could render and then call from would be useful. The idea here would be that we have to extend out each of those renders, i.e functions. I suppose that is like nested cloud functions, it could be interesting. Gelling to this point will require increasing the number issue tickets that we can generate / find including those outsides of the current main repository and migrating them all into just one? So we would have a different repository for each cloud function, but try to keep the issues within just the main repository, this way we could keep track of the functions and their issues but also keep to a hybrid-style source code management. This is because some of the cloud functions will remain behind a private wall, to avoid direct copying or abuse, while keeping some of the cloud functions public. In addition, we could create a mermaid style graph for each of the interpolation that we reference within the nested functions.

I will push through some of the general updates and then sync the repo before I grab my mini-laptop.\n- 6:30am - Pushing the sync command and taking a nice break from the house! Early morning touch grass sessions are so relaxing and fun, a great way to start the day.\n- 8:00am - While I am in the zone, I am going to layout an effective game plan for myself to quickly do sprints in the form of post-it style issue tickets. I am thinking to compile almost every issue within KBVE, projects and sub-projects into one large kanban. The idea here should be within the scope of keeping each issue / task within the size of a post-it note, minus any technical debt, like links and resources. I should make it a habit of doing this at least once a month, with the idea of keeping certain issues open until they get downsized to smaller ones that can be referenced back to the larger ones? I am rambling a bit here while I type away, but I suppose that is the idea of the journal. Keeping written logs and then typing logs?! Ugh.\n- 9:00am - As I am resting in my bed, hoping that I do not take a nap, I am thinking through all the small notes that I made and seeing how far I can push the kanban post-it game plan will be an interesting experiment. \n- 9:20am - Created an issue regarding the A to Z of FinTech. I am going to try and keep dual set of logs, a bit of double accounting style with how I approach each unit within the kanban board. \n- 10:22am - Quickly rolled a SPY $442 call for Monday , quick $50 and rolled 2 TSLA $270 put for $800. Completely forgot to do my Friday specials xD, dumped all that extra cash into O, for about 13 shares, which is another $3.30 additional monthly income. \n- 10:30am - Twitch Mockup / Builder concept notes?

I believe the major goal for the day is to get through about a couple of the issue tickets and organize some of the cloud functions. I should move the older set of functions into a private github repo and then test the deployment of them through there. There might be some issues with how deployment would work within the scope of hybrid repos, where the sub-modules would be from hidden repos or 3rd party locations, but I suppose that is the part where we learn and find out.\n- 6:05am - The automated deployment will be a bit interesting because there are a couple different active entities that would be called, so it can create a bit of confusion, as there would be a decent chunk of vastly different moving parts. Software does not always like to work together, but with enough safety checks and cross communication, we should be able to get the majority of the concept and MVP up and running. We are soon reaching the time of a massive launch, it will feel great to come out of the shadow with massive swings into the public realm. I suspect there will be a bit of delay and bug abusing within the first couple months, but there will be a great burden that will be lifted.

There was a solution to use a 3rd party plugin, but I felt like it might best to step away from that for now and use write something a bit more simple. \n- 6:50am - Renaming the `/auth/` path to `/account/` to keep the same naming convention across the multiple tenets. I should note that I am thinking of renaming the RogueJester to RentEarth and pivoting the gaming to be a bit more focused on this concept. It would be an interesting shift per say, but it seems that the marketing potential is definitely higher with this name. I suppose the RJ is a codename for the project and is not the final title name. I find it interesting how even the name of a video game can help determine its future, at least to an extent that falls under the branding. \n- 8:27am - The next step within the RentEarth saga will be to build out the state / storage, I am thinking that I might use nanostores library for this, as it also has a very solid task system. \n- 10:52am - I created an issue ticket related to the storage situation, it would be called inside of various platforms from React to our mobile apps to Unity. Thinking through how we would go about setting it up, I am also thinking that while we do it, we should also build a proof of concept. I suppose we could look into making it a npm package?

One of the issues to note would be that scenes might be referenced through their index number rather than a string. To resolve that issue, in the ASync loading of the scenes, it only accepts the string of the scene, however we have not yet migrated to that setup.

The idea would be to get the truck but work it out another company, so that the insurance for the truck would be under the company policy, rather than under my name. I do not mind buying a new truck but I really do not want to increase my monthly / semi-annual insurance premium by having another object to cover. This falls into the lack of abstract income to cover increases in my expenses, definitely if I want to afford trips to places like Japan or Amsterdam, both being within less than two years. One of the worst feelings is paying the insurance premium but never driving my tesla, like paying six months and then the car never moved, it just hurts my soul. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.\n> — <cite>Winston Churchill</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"July : 19","description":"Daily Log for July, 19 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1648294358557-80d5aeb2e396?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-07-19T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"07-20.md","slug":"07-20","body":"\n## Notes\n### 2023\n- 8:00am - I had a feeling that TSLA would have stayed at around $280 to $300 mark, did not expect it to dip well below that mark. Even with decent earnings, I did not expect the hype train to slow down but I guess operating margins decreasing could spook some investors. \n- 3:00pm - I am thinking of migrating certain aspects of the form design into its own tsx library that I can reference in the future without any major issues. The `Form.tsx` will be the first rewrite before I do it again when migrating to the `DF.tsx` , however I did want to implement a modal / toast system for the form submission, which would make sense to do inside of the `FormForm` concept, furthermore I suppose I could also add validation down the line within the component. Extending out some of the features will be interesting too, definitely once it comes to certain cloud functions, which I will be excited to do! I do want to reuse some of these template and eco-system later down the line for another application or two. We could extend it to RareIcon, CityVote, Herbmail and several other projects within this year.  As for generating revenue and marketing, I am aiming to get that going in August, at least a decent sized pipeline towards promoting the application. We can spend a whole year or more in development hell but getting users and feedback will be very vital.\n- 4:50pm - There are a couple concepts that we were thinking for FormForm, including what type of content should be passed through the form, including if there should be an id for the form, a default message and the general scope of the fields and the trigger. I still need to work on how I handle the typescript, as it is still something that I am not 100% familiar with and/or confident to an extent. I am also thinking of deleting the DF component for the time being but that might be later on the line. \n- 5:22pm - We could look at the removal of the `app` folder later down the line too. I should make an issue ticket with this down the line. As for the main issues that I am facing with Tamagui, it seems that they have resolved them but placed them under a private code base / license that would make things a bit more difficult for me to use when working on an open source project, so I will have to get a bit creative with how I want to handle this. I am going to avoid any additional purchases for now doe.\n- 5:43pm - I think I should look into extending out the validation through the `FormField` within the `Form.jsx` and include a type that would be under the validation? Okay the general `FormForm` proof of concept was added into the Login screen but we would have to migrate the `useEffect` from React out of the whole flow, so I am thinking we could migrate that logic into the action or task system within the nano stores? That would resolve some of future performance issues with calling too many renders. I suppose the next step would be to look over the VE class that I was looking at before and see if I could implement a way to handle that without issues. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Nothing could be worse than the fear that one had given up too soon and left one unexpended effort that might have saved the world.\n> — <cite>Jane Addams</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ]","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"July : 20","description":"Daily Log for July, 20 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1688939302741-52cd4d33412a?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-07-20T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"07-21.md","slug":"07-21","body":"\n## Notes\n### 2023\n- 9:00am - Going to do a couple quick rounds of the `H` but honestly it seems to be getting a bit boring and out of place. I definitely need something a bit more rewarding or well obtuse, maybe it might be time to hit that cookie clicker flow per say. \n- 12:20pm - Friday! Time to roll some of the TSLA calls/puts out for another week, I have to be careful on how far out I extend them, as I only have a couple thousand dollars to work with. This is okay for the time being as my REITs monthly income has been growing really well this past few months but I want it to grow faster. I should aim for around $10,000 a month within the next 2-3 years.\n- 1:14pm - Going to run a couple quick games of the new Arena game mode on League of Legends aka the `H`. As for the official plans, I believe moving forward we will be naming the game `RentEarth` as we build out the website.\n- 10:54pm - Went through a decent chunk of the backlogs, addressing a couple major concerns and I will have another chunk to add into the current list. There was a Coolify issue that I needed to address, which caused an error in the way we were storing the secrets, but a quick roll back was able to handle that. This does mean that I will have to look over the backup system and maybe implement a whole new one. \n- 11:50pm / EOD - The credit structure will still remain the same as of right now. `$1.00 = 1,000,000` , `$0.10 = 100,000` and `$0.01 = 1,000`. With the creation of the database, the documentation will look like this `$1.00 = 1M , $0.10 = 100K and $0.01 = 1K` as short hand notation. We currently have a couple bulk orders that we can process once we launch the credit system, I am just being extremely careful on how I approach this, as any mistake in this area could cause a major upset / problem later down the line. I did make a promise-style note for the first bulk batches to be discounted for certain early groups, with the condition that these bulk credits would only be used for KBVE services and not re-sold. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Only through our connectedness to others can we really know and enhance the self.

This includes the login, register and general profile scope for now. We want to at least get the bare components resolved and then work on expanding the rest. I am not too sure if I want to add SSO to the website for now, but it might be something that I will look into in the future. \n- 8:27am - We would look or make the minion class to be that of all encompassing? That does not feel like it would be the best, hmm. Okay as I am re-writing this out, I am thinking that it would make more sense to isolate the possible commands into different tasks, yet how would we handle the data that is being sent over? Would there have to be specific styles of input/output per say that we would have to handle? Like are we sending a `Data` map/array filled with different atoms , i.e string, number, boolean? There still has to be some level of logic and thought to this, one that makes the most sense. \n- 9:00am - While I am programming, I am listening to a couple different podcasts with some lofi-jams and it is nearly perfect, I really should just stream this as a 24/7 style session, where its just random podcasts and the lofi-beat. Granted there would be some copyright issues, so I suppose we would have to have someone break down the podcasts and provide input? Like a deep dive style where we take a single podcast episode and expand it out by going deeper into the content. \n- 11:08am - Got my coffee and moved up some of the pipelines that were in private/public. We are making progress in some areas but are still a bit held back in others, specifically the client storage. I am still working out the logical flow on how we should handle it all, but maybe isolating it all into different files might not be the best idea. I will try to keep it small and easy for now.\n- 2:04pm - I have returned back to my programming zone. The next task would be to setup `v0id` and `minion`. With void being the main task handler and minion being the task wrapper. I do need to transfer over some of the written notes that I have to this journal sheet but damn sometimes I am just getting lazy, huh. Okay so minion calls `minionLogin` which will handle the client-side validation before calling the API to login? This will help put a bit less stress onto the API and it just makes sense to do. I am thinking we could pass validation through as a regex string? It is a shame that we can not call React Hook Forms directly or this would be a lot easier and I am not going to pay for their private source takeout. Ugh.\n- 2:40pm - Migrating the Sheet/Toast modal from the home screen into the Form, with the purpose of utilizing it in between the submissions of each form. This way the modal opens when the form is busy? There are a couple ways that I can go about handling this. The other idea that I am thinking about right now would be to just (a) merge the sheet and toast into the FormForm class and (b) remove the `useState` and utilize the `useStore` to handle the control of modal / sheet and toast message. I noticed a couple errors with the current build that I have but this might be a better way to resolve the issue without overcomplicating the situation. \n- 2:50pm - I believe it is time to take a quick break and play a quick round of the H. But before I do, let me convert this upper left hand box for tomorrow. \"&\" This epic idea that I am thinking could work great would be to build/expand a couple of the Postboy foundlings (typo?) and add a couple new structures into the mix. Now on a/ai side note, I should finish the three manga's that I had planned out. The first being the fintech A-Z and then the Japanese A-Z Conch Manga. After doing those two, I can migrate one of the threads, which is for the Rogue Jester/Rent Earth. After the break, I will address this issue: Warning: Cannot update a component (`FormToast`) while rendering a different component (`FormToast`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `FormToast`, follow the stack trace as described in https://reactjs.org/link/setstate-in-render. I am aware of the reason this issue exists, it was how I handled the code migration.\n- 5:49pm - Okay, it seems that I was able to resolve that render issue by migrating some of the general react states into the nano stores. The plan was to replace the Boolean for the toast and numeric value for position, however I am not too sure how I should handle the error code reset. Currently on the dismissal of the modal, I am resetting the `toast$` back to false and the `error$` back to `undefined`. Yet as I am working through the current code base... I am taking a bit of time to be reflective. Am I being the most optimized or letting myself overthink and overengineer? Besides the insecurities that come with a new project and/or new code-base, I have to make sure I find a decent balance of hackery and professionalism.\n- 6:40pm - As I am watching some Trigun, I am definitely thinking of throwing in some references! It would only be fun and a fair tribute to one of the best shows out there lol. Damn the show has some of the best lines / quotes, all of them are straight bangers. I am enjoying how they are building up to the story's main antagonist / villain, I really forgot how great the writing has been for this show. Also, Wolfwood is still one of the best side characters in manga history, a perfect story arch. Okay today's important function will be `FormForm`, which currently takes 4 stores as the main state and information slot. I believe this would be a good time to look over the codebase as well, looking for specific areas to refactor. We should definitely place one of the future storages after the priest, I guess I will have to do that asap before I forget.\n- 7:57pm - Test casing on line 92, `OnPress` seems to work fine when attached to the trigger and the next move would be to dismiss the keyboard when the button gets pressed, thus we know that there are two ways that we can handle the `event`. I am still figuring out what would be the best way to go about it, looking through the docs right now. \n- 10:05pm - Switching over to the cyberpunk series! It has been a while since I saw the series, but damn its epic. Going from Trigun to Edgerunner was the wave!\n\n## Quote\n\n> But man is not made for defeat.

I think throwing up a couple quick UX/UI elements would be the best course of action for the time being.\n- 3:16pm - Going through the CI/CD and I am looking at adding a couple tools and rebuilding the pipeline to be a bit more friendly to bots. I am currently looking at how to add codesee maps into the patchs as well as sweep.ai into the mixture.

I am sorry, I must get stronger. The difference in self confidence will be depend on my ability to morph into the Rock or become a hermit buddha. \n- 12:00pm - Roll my weekly option contracts and then take the credits! I will have a bit of a slow week, I am only looking at around $500~ in profits, as I am slowly diminishing my cash reserves a bit too fast. Ideally I would want to slow it down, but there are only so many cuts that I can make and the generation of income has also been growing too slow. I made notes of this earlier but need to get back on the grind.\n- 2:00pm - I am test casing the patch system but there are a couple things that I am already not a big fan of! The current bug that is driving me a bit nuts is why can't codesee's graph generation proc faster? I am thinking that I should experiment a bit with their action? Maybe I should merge their action with the patch pull action? It would be worth a shot to see what would happen. Furthermore, I need to start moving the needle on the backend auto-deployment and tackle some of the unique bugs that I know will come up.\n- 3:20pm - Taking a bit of a programming / dev break and looking over my MTG card/deck. I am really thinking that I should build my trump and yoda deck before I play in person again. Both of the decks will be about 100 cards each and follow the EDH format, but I play with cool people, so proxy cards are always acceptable. I refuse to spend too much money on MTG cards and honestly `puttin` Trump onto the field and letting my friends destroy him, has its own unique taste to it. The coolest part about the deck is that I get to spawn Trump walls, which only make Trump stronger too lmfao. \n- 8:15pm - Mini Charles aka Charlie needs to come back online as well. I started to plug some of the base components within the older StormTrooper PC Tower, the good news is that it turns on but the neutral news is that we are not too sure how well it can run and there are way too many spider webs. If any PC gamer saw what I have done to this machine, dear lord.\n- 8:32pm - Updating my daily journal and then going to push through the addition of codesee to the patch workflow action, let us see if that was worth wild. \n\n## Quote\n\n> Technology is anything that wasn't around when you were born.\n> — <cite>Man Ray</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] R&D The Pipeline","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"July : 24","description":"Daily Log for July, 24 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1687735974899-a2bcd8d1cc85?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-07-24T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"07-25.md","slug":"07-25","body":"\n## Notes\n### 2023\n- 6:00am - The birds are starting to become a pain, not only are they taking a bit of an excessive dump on my car, they seem to be multiplying a bit faster around our home.

The current setup is through ansible and terraform but I wanted to migrate towards utilizing Github actions to execute the commands. Part of the reason was to build custom and future tools that I could bring into eco-systems, which could help with auto-scaling, security and general automation. \n- 11:00am - Going to roll some more option contracts, it seems that I no longer have any SPY within my inventory, which is a shame because getting back into the puts seem a bit too expensive for the casual return. I will wait for my TSLA/AAPL/GOOG to calm down and approach SPY again mid-August. Cash balance is around $68,000 but our position in $O has been increasing rapidly, we should approach $2000 monthly dividends by late 2024. \n- 12:00pm - Getting ready to take my mom to the dentist, she is about to get a root canal on her 13th or 14th tooth. I am sure she will be fine but I am a bit upset that she did not get dental work done when she was in India! Granted she has dental insurance but she should have taken advantage of the fact that getting teeth work done in India would be cheaper and better, oh well. \n- 2:05pm - Building out the pipeline with additional bots, including CodeSee, so that I can get visual images within the pull request. These images represent the file changes and their relationship through SVGs. I believe a future product could be in the works to help further aid in this area, including one that could summarize the changes into a brief statement? Like a GPT Agent aka a bot that would read through the code changes and present a couple paragraphs describing what those changes have done.\n- 4:00pm - Market has closed with some wiggle room before tomorrow's fed meeting. I am really hoping that they pause interest rates with a decent pause until late Q4 of 2023! If they do increase the rate, I am hoping that it is a steady 25bps instead of a 50bps.\n- 6:00pm - I started to clean up mini-Charles aka Charlie's work area and should note down the updates that I would need for it. I could add more information into the issue ticket and then migrate that information over to the documentation of Charlies?

My aim should be just to get at least one image out there a week, going towards 10 a week seems a bit much. \n- 8:20am - Okay I need to write this out as a journal entry first, then I will make it into an issue ticket and finally migrate it over to the rareicon documentation? We take an AI generate image / concept and then add our own artistic touches to it, we could paint our own version of it or use photoshop over the image. Afterwards we would render or display the image inside a digital frame and then using my sony alpha, we take a photo of that digital display somewhere in the real world? It would be a bit of augmented reality and I think it could create some really stunning and visually pleasing photo images. I feel like that is was similar to the Opsz concept that I still need to get out there, damn these backlogs are becoming a pain.\n- 11:50am - I believe we have a solid plan for the day! I am going to pickup @andsam and we are about to have a solid kbve session, it will start off with a visit to my 2nd favorite deli, Mr. Subs! I am just craving their 14c, which is a turkey, cheese and capicola cold sub with bacon inside a fresh gutted loaf of little Italy. Honestly my only concern is that they will run out of fresh bread but if they do, I have a backup plan because right next to the deli is a ramen shop, which happens to also make some of the best ramen in NJ! So there is always a win when visiting that area. After we get our meal, we shall visit the home and then take a look at the current physical state of all the hardware. This will include the charlies, drones and other robots for the time being! Wrapping up the deli and robot lab adventure will be some quick caffeine infusion and finally a visit to el Portal. \n\n## Quote\n\n> We do not quit playing because we grow old, we grow old because we quit playing.\n> — <cite>Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] - Robo Foodie Day.","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"July : 26","description":"Daily Log for July, 26 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1689281094204-62f756364c57?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-07-26T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"07-27.md","slug":"07-27","body":"\n## Notes\n### 2023\n- 2:30pm - Going through the base scene on the RogueJester aka RentEarth, trying to resolve the bug issue with Vuplex.

The other issue is that the mouse is not being registered by the frame, so the mouse clicks are not passing through. I believe both of these can be resolved within a week or so, hopefully we can get it resolved sooner so we can move forward. \n- 2:57pm - As I am writing these notes down, I think it would be wise to publish this patch out and then sync the codebase? Hopefully it will not cause any major error, ah shit as I was writing this, I see that there is a merge conflict that is already appearing. Sometimes I do wish working with git would be easier. We need that AI agent to come in and do some general git cherry picking for us.\n- 3:49pm - Okay there are a couple issues that we have to address with how we want to handle the scenes within RJ. I am thinking we would do a couple, maybe around 3-5 scenes within the base scene.

There are two ways we can go about this, one would be to build out the netcode and continue to use 3rd party integrations OR we could start a new project under the Unity 2022 and migrate 2021 assets over. There would be some drawbacks, as if Opsive might not work as well in 2022, but we can just let those go for the time being. I will continue to go through the C# codebase and see what I can do on that end.\n- 11:15am - I am still having some issues with dependency injections, so I might take a look at the 2nd option this weekend and see where I can get with it.

For now we will run with both and see where we can get within the scope of a weekend or two. There still needs to be a couple updates that have to be done on the main website, so that it can interact with the Unity, but I could sync those updates, such that it would work on both scenes without any major issue. The scene management and naming structure would have to still remain the same, so there has to be abstract documentation that can help keep track of the different scenes. We will keep to at least 5 general scenes, which would be the Menu, Base, Island, City and Misc? I suppose there could be a bit more edits here and there but these should work fine for the time being. \n- 4:53pm - Cloning the MegaCity repo right now and going to use that as the base for the RentEarth repo. Let us see if we can get this migrated over a bit faster than what I would have hoped? This would be an interesting test case of how to move a project from an older version of Unity to a new one.

I will first have to create the project in the Unity dashboard, then clone the Megacity Multiplayer over via Github, then migrate the codebase over to RentEarth? Well let us see how fast I can do this all, while still doing other things in the background. This is a high level of multi-task that I was not expecting to do today. I might even have to upgrade the computer in the basement, so that it would be easier to build this out in. \n- 5:11pm - Damn I installed 2022.3.5 but the project seems to be on 2022.3.3, so I will have to install that editor again. I am not too sure if I want to do any updates besides what they have provided, i.e it might break things that I do not want to repair later down the line. One of the other things that I am going to do is keep this to a local play only, as I really do not want to enable their UGS, burn through $800 in idle credits, plus it would be fun to keep this game kinda like a classic, per say. The fact that the code-base could support upwards of 200+ players is interesting, 64 is what their readme says.... I want to see where I can go with pushing those limits. As the install is preparing, I am going to brush up on some of the tutorials and links, I figured reading through and consuming as much information as I can before taking on this complexity will be its own adventure. Getting the project to open and run will be the first step tonight, once I get that resolved, I will do the first test build and see how it performs on my laptop. After the test local build, I suppose I could plan out different paths to take. Two of the major ones that I would see are in the scope of the client and server builds, with the server build having some levels of complexity that I should look into. Going from an automated pipeline build of the game to a server-ready image, then having it automatically become hosted on a dedicated server would be really the bees knees.\n- 8:30pm - I believe that I might not have enough resources to handle the larger version of the game. Just loading the map takes forever, but there are a couple interesting things that I like about the newer version of unity. Furthermore this Megacity build has some interesting examples of UI components that extend out of the general TextMeshPro, but I did not get enough time to dive deeper into how they work. \n\n## Quote\n\n> It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.\n> — <cite>William Shakespeare</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Tasks?

Part of my plan will be to automate some of the LinkedIn functions, maybe have it send custom GPT-based messages to people that I would like to reach out to. The general idea would be to at least have the introduction message be a bit personal? I also made sure to claim the company page for KBVE! As for why I decided to improve my social presence? Hmm, I was a very anti-social media, in the sense that it felt like it was very manipulative and corrupt, however that does not mean I should not at least engage in some form of gray-hat! I found that there were some clients that wanted automation tools within Instagram, Twitter, etc... and having a better background in understanding how they functioned would make it a bit easier to build those tools out? There are a decent chunk of tools already out there, I will just focus on making one that is very simple to run inside of a docker container. I was thinking of extending out some of my unity knowledge and then build it out from there but the idea of running the application in a lightweight but scalable approach seems to be the best move for now. \n- 11:30am - Idea! I am thinking that I should look into building out that license system. This would allow people to sell license key through our KBVE portal, where we would then provide unique features that would help verify and protect their licensed software. Part of this feature would also be to include various ways to license and protect your software when it comes to distribution. The license system would need a decent name that would be cute but not too over the top, just a bit of `OwO` but not too much of `AwA`. Definitely will need a hint of `nani!?`.\n- 1:50pm - Going to do a couple quick league matches before doing some general workflow management. I will take a couple hours to update the general website, maybe finalize the blog theme template too.\n- 2:56pm - Time to synch this with the current branch and then redo the blog design theme.  I also have to remember to migrate some of the older or really old blog content from back in the day into the main collection. It will be interesting going down memory lane and grabbing those really old articles. I should also look into setting up the interview format, there has been some great moments, and as such, I should have a decent interview template and question bank ready to ask those that are special individuals that I run into. \n- 3:11pm - Going through their message system, it looks like I could use Puppeteer to help cycle through the automated messages that I am getting... ugh it does feel a bit weird that I have to automate a response to the automated messages that I am getting, but it is what it is. I guess that Internet is really turning into a cluster of bots, part of the time I am thinking that it is just a collection of bots that all just engage with everything xD.\n- 3:23pm - Let me sync this journal log before opening Unity, it was the first time that I had a blue screen crash on my laptop in a while.\n- 4:10pm - Pushed the patch changes and it looks like I need to make a new workflow that would prepare for release? I suppose that would be a staging workflow, we could build that out under `staging.yml` under the GitHub workflows. The idea behind this would be to mimic the movement from a developer branch to the main branch, here we could do the code reviews, version control and test case a couple deployment concepts. One of which I was thinking would be to create an automated response that would use GPT to summarize the results from the changes. A GPT powered release note? I suppose this would be an area where we could test case the SSR components of Astro too. \n- 4:17pm - Time to get some coffee and red bull while I wait for this to build out. Damn the compiler? Maybe Unity is eating up resources a bit too much. Going to switch back to the blog design.\n- 8:24pm - Okay I think I got the basics of the blog design down, now I just need to figure out what type of variables we should include? \n- 9:20pm - Finished making some fresh veggie pizza via the naan method, it was so filling and powerful, honestly it could be a healthy fast food in the future. Okay so I think we got a general gist of the blog format, with a simple MDXJS widget as well, which would help stylize, if that is a word, the general notes and information. I think the worst part of GPT is that it is moving my brain closer towards the matrix, it was bad already to have to google things, but all this is doing is moving the goal post closer towards the matrix. \n- 10:13pm - Time to update AstroJS and maybe play a couple quick rounds of League. There should be a way\n\n## Quote\n\n> The entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity.\n> — <cite>Peter Drucker</cite>\n\n---\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [ ] Blog Post Design","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"July : 29","description":"Daily Log for July, 29 of each year.","tags":["daily"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1675351085230-ab39b2289ff4?fit=crop&q=85&w=1400&h=700","date":"2023-07-29T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"id":"asset.mdx","slug":"asset","body":"\n## J5\n\nGoing to split the branches up and then start a dev-asset-automation branch, where the n8n will commit automated commits/pushes.\nThe goal should be that all automation data mining goes through the branches, just to make sure everything is correct and to avoid any possible exploits/mal-intent.\n\n## J4\n\nI am thinking that we should construct abstract Scenes for assets, so that we can reference each aspect of them via modularity / first principle levels. If I wanted to render the assets charts, I should just be able to reference a component for the types of charts and get back what I need, rendered and compressed. We can start with simple charts and then expand them with more style, options and information. Starting with chart0 being the most basic and then we re-do/re-build as we move up from chart1 to chart9, ect...\n\nI guess the question would be how far we would want to expand the charts at the static level and then when should we start to integrate dynamic data endpoints to the charts. I believe that should be handled after we get the backtraced charts out of the way.\n\n## J3\n\n- Stripping out the extra information, such as option contract data, forward PE, RSI, ect...\n- Short hand titles might be a future issue as we scale out from 100 assets to 1000, 10000, 100K\n- International stocks also have additional tags that might cause duplication, I think the best move would be to modify them manually until we can get a better system in place?\n\n## J2\n\n- h0lybyte: I was able to pull 100 assets, format them into json. However, I was running into an issue when turning the json list of assets into MD files.\n- h0lybyte: In the n8n pipeline, the charts / img data gets stripped out.\n\n## J1\n\n- h0lybyte: Open Issue [#88](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.com/issues/88)\n  - We will expand the amount of stock assets to around 100 and then do some data mining / data parsing for the 100~ assets as a test case. We might also expand a bit of the crypto. I was thinking it might be best to do a couple initially by hand, to see how we can build out & map out the total automation process , which will include fetching / updating.\n  - Basic pipeline would look like this: `n8n -> function_asset -> fx{var: ticker} -> .json -> .md -> gist`\n","collection":"journal","data":{"title":"Asset Dev Log","description":"Dev Log for Asset Page of KBVE!","tags":["asset"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1610993302487-6dbfc0acf4ed?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}},{"id":"visualnovel.mdx","slug":"visualnovel","body":"\n\n## J2\n\nh0lybyte: Okay we got the pipeline operational, even unicorned Github a couple times but it looks like it should be smooth sailing for the time being.

I believe the best stance would be for both parties to come together and focus on a few key issues: \n\n- A. The removal of evergreening pharma / trollish patents [2].\n- B. Reverse the bans on the importation of drugs.\n- C. Grants and Tax Incentives.\n\n(a) student & machine learning/researching within particular healthcare niches (EPS for STEM investment is amazing for the society), (b) progressive* generic manufacturing, (c) open sourcing all research/action data (help offset the billions lost for failed drugs), [4] allow all entities (NGO, Medicare ~ not just VA) to barter drug prices, thus upper-limit price regulation, [5] heavy levy-tax on harmful entities/corps/substances, [6] fiduciary-like regulations && career-limitation/bans (No revolving door) for doctors/hospitals staff/health + persons that operate in government agencies like FDA / EPA, etc... This view is based on a 6 fucking hour flight without wifi; fueled by meme withdrawals, lack of sleep, desires for CISPHER the ghost to save the world, and investments in designer babies made in artificial wombs.\n\n[1] Evergreening Pharma Patents - this is a classical move played by pharma companies to continue to make profits off of loopholes within the broken patent system. While every company/entity has the right to defend its expensive patent, it is unethical and greedy for them to use Dinsey-like legislation to monopolize social health and social networking programs. A case in point would be Epipens, granted there is a generic on the market but it was an issue, including its internal situation, definitely a good read. This is a massive issue in other nations, including India. From this point, you could also stem into how flawed the patent system is  /  patent trolling. I also believe the patent fight over CRISPR is a prime example of how burning money verse for a greater cause. \n\n[2] Allowing drugs to be imported from EU/Canada (besides just OTC) would dynamically create, destroy and restructure how drugs are obtained; imagine a doctor writing you a prescription which then automatically enters an amazon-esque online marketplace, where you can opt to get it delivered to your house. This already exists for the most part, but it is very unethical and illegal, I have talked to people that get all their expensive drugs [diabetic, hepi-1, adhd] drugs via the mail from Canadian/EU/Foreign pharmacies. It's cheaper to fly to India, stockpile drugs, enjoy a good vacation, get surgery, and fly back verse doing it all here.\n\n[2b] If a company wants to produce a generic to compete against a monopoly, especially if the trust is on an expired-patented drug, then there should be massive tax incentives/tax breaks to encourage the de-monopolization of that said drug. This does go hand-in-hand with the patent issue and the importation issue. Some drugs have a monopoly within the US because it's illegal to have that said drug be imported. \n\n[3a] Open-sourcing the research/data should allow companies to escape heavy tax burdens if they are attempting to produce a drug but it fail to enter the market. It would help other entities continue the research while preventing others from making the same mistake. If a company spends billions in R&D, test cases, etc… then the government should ensure that the company does not go bankrupt from taxation, especially when the current market for R&D is fueled by investors, which we do not want to lose/push away. \n\n[3b] If a student graduates high school with a high enough GPA, then they should have free access to community college, followed by access to free public university if they are doing R&D for health/engineering / algorithmic / STEMish. ; higher learning schools are already expensive, which is discouraging and harmful at the end of the day. I rather see more youth thrown into the education cycle rather than the criminal.\n\n[4] I am sorry but damn Cali, you guys had a chance to lower the fuck out of our medicare costs (they are super high for the state)… but you guys didn't want to vote that equal right for drug bartering? :C, now I will go back and invest in those pharma stocks dat $abbv.\n\n[5] If it's going to cause cancer, heart complications, and obesity, then there better be a tax on that shit! With all that tax money going back strictly toward medical / health ideals. Tax on Soda, Tax on Fast Food, etc. Furthermore, there should be heavy fines/taxes on entities that release harmful chemicals into the environment, like coal plants && pollution fines up the ass. We should not have Exxon get away from dumping hazardous materials and then allowing shareholders to profit off of it.\n\n[6] Pharma reps should, at most, be allowed to give free samples for their drugs, but other than that, they should NOT be allowed to use any other monetary actions to gain/alter/manipulate/influence. No more free lunches! FDA needs a massive cleanse, it is filled with corruption and backdoor policies.

It has been expanded upon through various periods of time and still continues to be improved.\n\n* * *\n\n## Eisenhower Matrix\n\n- The theory places all objectives through a simple quadrant based upon the priority.\n\n- We have added onto the existing Eisenhower Matrix system, such that we also have a simple priority\nnumbering system on top of it. The system is as follows:\n  - Urgent & Important: This is set in Github Projects as \"1 U-I\"\n  - Urgent & Not Important: This is set as \"2 U-NI\"\n  - Not Urgent & Important: This is set as \"3 NU-I\"\n  - Not Urgent & Not Important: This is set as \"4 NU-NI\"\n\n- Then in the labels for the issues, we've added a numbering system that starts at zero (lowest priority) and can scale infinitely, with higher numbers being higher priority. For now, we have just 0 through 3, designated as Low, Medium, High, and Very High Priority.\n- With this, in Github Projects, we can group by the Eisenhower Matrix, and then sort by labels.\n- If the priority labels start with the number, then they'll be sorted by those priorities.

Is lightly expanding on titles or being more specific with each title, this way when whoever needs to do that task already knows exactly what it is, so its the same picture in everyone's head, leading to a lot less confusion and potentially preventing the situation of whomever is working on the task making something completely different than what it was supposed to be\n>Jab5: the other thing id more or less think about is potentially setting specific times/lengths on different tasks, as that helps to make sure that things more or less do get done in the first place. This largely subjective because it depends a lot on how your group works on it for example if its just every once in a while then that probably wont be very helpful. But having an understanding of the time frame on the individual tasks is something that will always potentially be useful\n>Jab5: And just remember the tool is only as good as your team uses it. So if its just one person interacting with it then honestly going into a large large amount of detail may potentially be more trouble than its worth\n>Jab5: but thats just what i got from looking at how its all arranged from the outside.

Technology is still present, but it is powered by clean, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, and designed to work in harmony with nature.\n\nSome of the key themes of solarpunk include environmentalism, social justice, and the rejection of consumerism and materialism. The goal of solarpunk is to inspire people to imagine and create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.\n\nThe solarpunk movement aims to inspire and promote real-world solutions for creating a sustainable and just future. In short, the theory of solarpunk is a hopeful and optimistic vision of the future that challenges us to imagine and create a more sustainable and just world. It encourages us to think creatively and collaboratively, and to take action to create the future we want to see.\n\n* * *\n\n## Focus on Renewable Energy\n\nWith energy being an important pillar and foundation of the theory, Solarpunk imagines a future world where society is powered by renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, rather than fossil fuels. This means that buildings, vehicles, and other technologies are designed to be energy-efficient, sustainable and prosperous.\n\n## Connection to Nature\n\nSolarpunk emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with nature. This means incorporating natural elements like greenery and water into urban design, and designing technology to work with, rather than against, the environment.\n\n## Community and Cooperation\n\nIn a solarpunk world, people work together to create sustainable systems and infrastructure. This means that there is a strong emphasis on community and cooperation, rather than individualism and competition.\n\n## Social Justice\n\nSolarpunk recognizes that environmental issues are intertwined with social issues like poverty and inequality. Therefore, solarpunk aims to create a more just and equitable society, where everyone has access to clean energy, clean water, and other basic necessities.\n\n## Rejection of Consumerism and Materialism\n\nSolarpunk challenges the idea that material possessions and consumption are the keys to happiness and fulfillment. Instead, solarpunk promotes a simpler, more sustainable lifestyle that focuses on experiences and relationships rather than possessions.\n\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\n\n# Energy\n\nRenewable energy is a central focus of solarpunk, as it is seen as a key solution to the environmental and social issues facing our world today. Furthermore, the theory represents a fundamental shift away from the destructive and unsustainable practices of the past, and towards a more sustainable and equitable future. Thus, by promoting, investing and expanding renewable energy sources, the theory of solarpunk seeks to create a more hopeful and optimistic vision of the future, where human society can thrive in harmony with the natural world.\n\n* * *\n\n## Climate Change Mitigation\n\nOne of the primary goals of solarpunk is to mitigate the effects of climate change. By promoting the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, solarpunk seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of climate change.\n\n## Energy Independence\n\nSolarpunk also aims to create a more decentralized and democratic energy system. By promoting the use of rooftop solar panels, community-owned wind turbines, and other forms of distributed energy generation, solarpunk seeks to reduce our dependence on centralized fossil fuel power plants and create a more resilient and flexible energy system.\n\n## Access to Energy\n\nSolarpunk recognizes that access to energy is a basic human right. By promoting the use of renewable energy sources, solarpunk seeks to create a more equitable energy system where everyone has access to clean and affordable energy.\n\n## Innovation and Creativity\n\nSolarpunk encourages innovation and creativity in the development of renewable energy technologies. By imagining new and creative ways to harness renewable energy, solarpunk seeks to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy system.\n\n* * *\n* * *\n* * *\n\n# Nature\n\nThe connection to nature is a core principle of solarpunk, as it recognizes the importance of living in consonance with the natural world. \n\n* * *\n\n## Biophilic Design\n\nSolarpunk promotes the use of biophilic design, which incorporates natural elements like greenery, natural light, and water into urban design.\nBiophilic design has been shown to improve human health and well-being, and also provides habitat for wildlife. \nBiophilic design is a design approach that seeks to incorporate natural elements and patterns into built environments in order to create a more harmonious and restorative relationship between people and nature.\nThe term \"biophilia\" was coined by the biologist E.O. Wilson to describe the innate human tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life.\n\n### Natural Materials\n\nBiophilic design incorporates natural materials like wood, stone, and clay, which have a natural and organic feel. These materials can be used for building facades, interior finishes, and furniture.\n\nExample of natural material usage within biophilic would be the tradition of tree shaping. \n\n### Natural Light\n\nThe design style seeks to maximize the use of natural light in built environments, which has been shown to have numerous health benefits. This can include designing buildings to maximize daylight, using skylights and light wells, and using reflective surfaces to bounce light deeper into interior spaces.\nFurthermore, incorporating views of nature into built environments has been shown to reduce stress and improve cognitive function. This can include designing buildings to offer views of natural landscapes, or creating green walls and roofs to bring nature indoors.\n\n### Hydroponics\n\nLandscape design often incorporates water features like fountains and ponds, which can have a calming effect and improve air quality. This is taken a step further by recylcing the grey waste water into a hydroponic instance, thus creating an indoor \n\n* * *\n\n## Sustainable Agriculture\n\n> Solarpunk recognizes that our food system is intimately connected to the health of the environment. Therefore, solarpunk promotes sustainable agriculture practices like regenerative farming, agroforestry, and permaculture, which work with the natural ecosystem rather than against it.\n> Sustainable agriculture is an approach to food production that seeks to balance economic, social, and environmental factors in a way that promotes long-term sustainability. Sustainable agriculture practices prioritize the health and well-being of the natural ecosystem, while also providing for the needs of people.\n\n### Regenerative Farming\n\nRegenerative farming practices aim to restore and improve the health of the soil. This can include practices like cover cropping, crop rotation, and reduced tillage, which help to build soil health, reduce erosion, and improve water quality.\n\n### Agroforestry\n\nAgroforestry acknowledges the importance of trees in food production systems. Therefore, agroforestry practices like integrating trees into crop fields or planting orchards can provide numerous benefits, including soil stabilization, increased biodiversity, and improved carbon sequestration.\n\n### Permaculture\n\nPermaculture incorporates permaculture principles, which aim to design food production systems that mimic natural ecosystems. Permaculture practices can include companion planting, mulching, and using natural pest control methods.\n\n### Localized Food Systems\n\nThe idea of local food systems, which can reduce the environmental impacts of food transportation, support local economies, and increase access to fresh, healthy food.\n\n### Biodiversity\n\n> Importance of biodiversity in maintaining healthy ecosystems. Therefore, sustainable agriculture practices prioritize the preservation and promotion of biodiversity in food production systems.\n\n#### Genetic Diversity\n\n> Biodiversity plays an essential role in maintaining the genetic diversity of crops and livestock. This diversity helps to ensure that agriculture is resilient to changes in climate, pests, and diseases, and that farmers have a wide range of options to choose from when selecting crops or animals that are best adapted to their specific conditions. Genetic diversity can also improve the quality of crops and livestock, such as by enhancing nutritional value or increasing yield\n\n#### Ecosystem Services\n\n> Biodiversity is crucial in providing ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, soil health, and water filtration. Pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, and birds, are essential for the reproduction of many crops, and the loss of these species could have severe impacts on food production. Similarly, natural predators can help control pests that would otherwise damage crops. Soil organisms such as worms and microbes help to maintain soil fertility and structure, which is vital for healthy plant growth.\n\n#### Resilience and Adaptability\n\n> Biodiversity provides resilience and adaptability to ecosystems and agricultural systems. A diverse range of crops and livestock reduces the risk of crop failure and animal disease outbreaks, which can devastate livelihoods and threaten food security. Diverse ecosystems are better able to adapt to changes such as climate change, drought, or flooding.\n\n#### Cultural Significance\n\n> Biodiversity is often intertwined with cultural practices and traditional knowledge. Many communities rely on specific plant or animal species for food, medicine, or cultural practices, and the loss of these species can have severe social and cultural impacts.\n\n* * *\n\n## Restoration of Ecosystems\n\nThe theory of solarpunk seeks to restore damaged ecosystems and promote biodiversity. This can include initiatives like reforestation, wetland restoration, and the creation of wildlife corridors.\n\n## Respect of Natural Resources\n\nSolarpunk recognizes that natural resources like water, air, and soil are finite and must be managed carefully. Therefore, solarpunk promotes the responsible use and conservation of natural resources.\n\n## Connection of the Outdoors\n\nSolarpunk encourages people to spend time outdoors and connect with nature. This can include initiatives like creating urban green spaces, promoting outdoor recreation, and encouraging people to spend time in natural environments.\n\n","collection":"theory","data":{"title":"SolarPunk","description":"SolarPunk is a hybrid movement within the technological and environmental eco-systems, with emphasis on utilizing nature.","tags":["design","dev","prompt","gpt"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497435334941-8c899ee9e8e9?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}}]

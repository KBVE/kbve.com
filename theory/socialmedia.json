Videos on motivation, health, fitness, investment, programming, philosophy. \n    \n    [4] - Let the YT Algorithm then continue to feed more videos within those topics / areas.\n    \n    It has helped a ton, again this is just a personal experiment / anecdotal but the concept is there, at the core level.\n    \n    *Stamp:* I agree with that. \n    \n    The algorithm also keeps users glued to the social media platforms for hours per day watching endless contents that sometimes are really wasteful.\n    It also creates a sense of pressure and competition to gain the most likes or more followers.\n    That creates distorted realities and fakeness as people want to gain as many followers as possible.\n\n</MDXJS>\n</Widget>\n</MDXLayer>","collection":"theory","data":{"title":"Social Media Toxicity","description":"Theory on the toxicity of social media and steps on improving its depths within our mental state.","tags":["social","media","mental","health"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1562577309-4932fdd64cd1?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}}}

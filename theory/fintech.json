We can start with breaking down the outline of all 26 letters, then expand their term to at least 3-5 sentences, which we will then feed into the machine to output a visual art piece for the respected letter. The style would be a mixture of classic 90s cartoons mixed with old school anime but we will test case out a couple and see where it goes from there.\n","collection":"theory","data":{"title":"FinTech","description":"We are breaking down and noting the different theories within fintech.","tags":["financial","tech","data"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1614680376739-414d95ff43df?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}}}

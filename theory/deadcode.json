There are multiple areas within the `deadcode` but the objective would be to help understand, learn and grow from the vast amount of old code.\n\n## History\n\nWe want to keep an archive of old / deprecated software scripts/libraries as a reference material for future programmers, hackers and researchers. As more and more codebases are fading out or being replaced, it might be wise to keep records of important functions and modules as an educational source of information.\n","collection":"theory","data":{"title":"DeadCode","description":"DeadCode is a theory that focuses on learning from archived code.","tags":["deadcode","theory"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1476370648495-3533f64427a2?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}}}

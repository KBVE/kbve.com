Finally the `{$user[@'host']}` represents the user connecting via the IP Address.\n\n---\n\n## Backup\n\nIf you need a quick way to backup the `mysql` database, then use this command below:\n\n```shell\nsudo docker exec [$mysql_container_name] /usr/bin/mysqldump -u [$mysql_username] --password=[$mysql_password] [$database_name] > [$destination_path]\n```\n\nYou could save the execution command as a shell file and/or reference it inside of your AWX stack.\n\nMore information on [AWX](https://kbve.com/application/ansible/#awx) and [Docker](https://kbve.com/application/docker/)\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n### Q&A\n\n- #### What to do if you just installed `mysql-server` on Ubuntu on WSL and it never even prompted you for a password?\n\n  - [Well here's a cool link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42421585/default-password-of-mysql-in-ubuntu-server-16-04) that tells you exactly what to do.\n  - Long story short it's like `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'` once you actually get in\n\n- #### What to do if you've never used this foreign and vaguely antiquated technology before and you wish you had a time machine that would let you go back in time so you could sit with the pioneers of this dying technology and learn from them what drugs they were smoking when they decided on the syntax?\n\n  - [Well here's a cool link](https://devhints.io/mysql) that will help in your journey to understand the aforementioned topics.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n### Log\n\n#### Journal\n\n<Details data=\"2023-04-11\">\n\nAdded the correct syntax and added the first widget.

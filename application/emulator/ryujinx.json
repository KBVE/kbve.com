Makes it so much faster!\n\n### Windows\n\nWe really recommend that you install the software via `choco` as it will save you time, effort and energy! If you need help check, come to our Discord or IRC.\n\nHere are the steps you would take to setup and install RyuJinx directly for Windows:\n\n1.  Download the Ryujinx emulator from the Ryujinx website.\n\t1. (a) You can choose to download the software from the Github repo as well! \n\t2. (b) Make sure you have your drivers updated!\n2.

I will have to spend some time setting that up on my `m1`, however I been told that it is a pain and is not really worth the amount of time to invest.\n\n--- \n\n## Setup\n\nAfter installing the software, you will have to look into setting up the `RyuJinx` and for that we recommend using `RyuSAK`, which can be found [here at the RyuSAK repo](https://github.com/Ecks1337/RyuSAK/release).\n\n</MDXJS>\n</Widget>\n</MDXLayer>\n","collection":"application","data":{"title":"RyuJinx","description":"This educational purpose only document is about the experimental software that was written in C#!","tags":["emulation","software","gaming"],"author":"KBVE Team","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1612036781124-847f8939b154?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75"}}}

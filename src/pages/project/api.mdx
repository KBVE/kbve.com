## Docs

- Official documentation will be provided for the API, we are currently going to base the API off of Strapi.

* * *

## Install

- To help scale the API backend, we are also currently developing the backend cluster of both the API and the database that stores the information (MariaDB).
    - Current Docker Compose for ve2
        <Github src="data/api/ve2/docker-compose.yml" description="This is the current docker compose for a ve2 that runs our API." />

## Uptime
- ![API Uptime Badge](https://api.checklyhq.com/v1/badges/checks/206925a6-0f7b-4669-a4fd-b61b3f5b70fc?style=for-the-badge&theme=default&responseTime=true)

## Auth
- Auth Journal 
  - For the core of the API, we will use JWT as the `key` in between the $User and $API.
- React JSX
  - The first mod will be the core auth system between the client $User and server $API, which includes the register and login. While we build it out, we will include generic defensive components into the foundation, then re-visit and apply external security, such as limits and firewalls (some may operate outside of the API).
    - Cookie Storage (of the JWT)
      - Cookie - `token` - will store the client $User JWT.
      - Cookie - `user` - will store the client $User data.
      - Library: `react-cookie` will be used to help maintain the cookies.

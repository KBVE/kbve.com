## PHP

! This needs to be rewritten. Its too memey.

PHP is a popular and powerful scripting language that can create dynamic and interactive web pages.
HP has many advantages and features that make it a widely-used, free, and efficient tool for web development. 
PHP is a server-side scripting language, which means that it runs on the web server and not on the browser. 
This allows PHP to interact with databases, files, sessions, cookies, and other web services.
PHP is also open-source, which means that it is free to download and use, and that anyone can contribute to its development and improvement. 
PHP is very simple to learn and use, as it can be embedded within HTML code and has a syntax that is similar to C and Java.
PHP supports multiple platforms, web servers, and databases, as well as object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming paradigms.
PHP also has many extensions and libraries for various purposes, such as graphics, encryption, XML parsing, email sending, and more.
In conclusion, PHP is a versatile and convenient scripting language that can create dynamic and interactive web pages with ease and efficiency.

#### SS_BETWEEN

```php

<?php
// Credit: AADude
 function ss_between($string,$start,$end) {
   $string=" ".$string; //The string.
   $startpos=strpos($string,$start); //Find the position of the start string.
   //Check if $startpos equals zero.
   if ($startpos == 0) {
      //If $startpos does equal zero, do this:
      return false; //Return false.
   }
   else {
      //If $startpos doesn't equal zero, do this:
      $startpos+=strlen($start); //Add the string length of $start to $startpos.
      $endpos=strpos($string,$end,$startpos)-$startpos; //Find the string position of $end.
      return substr($string,$startpos,$endpos); //Return the new value.
   }
}

// Proof of Of Concept
$source = "U:holybyteE:acid@meme.com";
$u = ss_between($source, "U:", "E:");
// $source = line 1 of text file
echo $u;
// return username
 
?>

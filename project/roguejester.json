Thus all of Patch 1.2.x will be towards getting everything for the player done.\n\nSo we were working on the pipeline, durning the development hell that is Unity, and ran into a \"Build\" success but a \"Build and Run\" failure.\n\nWe spent some time re-merging the base, switching branches, thinking it might be a cluster of different issues.\nSilver comes in clutch and finds out that there was a `duplicate on GameManager Prefab Replacer , 2 of the same script on same object`.\n\n</Details>\n\n<Details data=\"J6\">\n\n#### J6\n\n##### 05-10-2023\n\nOlder Entry has not been found saved within the cloud.\n\n</Details>\n\n<Details data=\"J5\">\n\n#### J5\n\n##### 11-15-2022\n\n- Had an issue with the basing earlier in the day. We will split the branches further, to avoid conflicts and issues when rebasing / merging branches.\n- When migrating from the public to private repo, there were some issues with `secrets` and CI/CD, these issues are still open and should be resolved this week.\n\n##### 11/14/2022\n\n- Improving the UI/UX\n- Expanding Character Stats\n\n</Details>\n\n<Details data=\"J4\">\n\n#### J4\n\n##### 11-11-2022\n\nOlder Entry has not been found saved within the cloud.\n\n  </Details>\n\n<Details data=\"J3\">\n\n#### J3\n\n##### 11-13-2022\n\n- Start expanding the assets inside the game and work with some core logic.\n- ZaneRage and h0lybyte did the basics the idea / concept.\n- New asset models for the 3D robot soldiers.\n- Added several more assets to the game!\n\n</Details>\n\n<Details data=\"J2\">\n\n#### J2\n\n##### 11-12-2022\n\nOlder Entry has not been found saved within the cloud.\n\n</Details>\n\n<Details data=\"J1\">\n\n#### J1\n\n##### 11-11-2022\n\nOlder Entry has not been found saved within the cloud.\n\n</Details>\n\n<Details data=\"J0\">\n\n#### J0\n\n##### 11-01-2022\n\n- Ideas How to Convert 1.

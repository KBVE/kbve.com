{"entry":{"id":"search-engine.mdx","slug":"search-engine","body":"\n## information\n\nThe search engine project or [/search/](https://kbve.com/search/) was meant to be a small but unique collection of search engines that I could easily utilize!\nI am getting a bit tired of switching amoung GPT-based and data-mine based search engines, i.e going from You's GPT to Google to Bard for searching. \nSo the solution that I am thinking was to create a general but search engine experience at the core and then extend it out with unique features.\nThe premise of this document was to keep a direct source for information related to the project that we could reference and keep up-to-date notes. \n\n\n## GPT\n\nThe GPT \n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\nThese are the notes for the search engine project by KBVE and the community. \n\n### Log\n\n- [X] Fix up CSS for the core search\n- [ ] Remove and restructure the tabs + unique search components. \n\n#### Journal\n\n##### 2023-05-19\n\nWe started to fix up the terrible generic Google CSS and started to overide some of the results. \n\n###### 2023-05-21\n\nMinor tweaks to the mobile and general dark mode of the search engine.\n\n### License\n\nThe license for the search project would be a bit tough because we are using several different search engines and license bases.\nI believe it would be a combination of the MIT and Apache but also copyright license / releases from each of the Engine that we use?\nI suppose this will have to be a future issue once we get a bit more complete and up to date.

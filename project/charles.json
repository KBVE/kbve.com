He used his metal arm to hack into the security system and opened a vent. \nHe crawled inside and made his way to the core.\n\nHe saw a huge chamber filled with wires that glowed with blue light. \nHe knew that each wire represented a human mind trapped in the Matrix. \nHe felt a pang of pity, but he also knew that this was the only way to free them. He took out a bomb and attached it to one of the wires. \nHe set the timer and ran back to the vent.\n\nHe heard an explosion behind him and saw sparks flying everywhere. \nHe smiled and thought that he had done it. \nHe had broken the wires within the Matrix. \nBut then he heard a voice in his head.\n\n\"Charles, wake up. You are still in the Matrix.\"\n\nHe felt a jolt of pain and realized that it was all a trap. \nHe had been tricked by the Agents into destroying a fake power plant. \nThey had used his cybernetic implants to manipulate his senses and make him believe that he was outside.\n\nHe opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a table, surrounded by wires that connected him to a machine. \nHe saw an Agent standing over him, holding a gun.\n\n\"Goodbye, cyber monkey,\" the Agent said and pulled the trigger.\n\n</Details>\n\n## Information\n\n* * *\n\n## Machine\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n## Notes\n\nNotes on the birth of Charles \n\n### Log\n\n#### Journal\n\n\n\n<Details data=\"2023-04-10\">\n##### 04-10-2023\n@h0lybyte\nWe could go with a workstation? server rack?

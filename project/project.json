This knowledge can then be used to improve the way cities operate.\n\nCity information software is a type of software that is used to collect, store, and analyze city data. It can help cities to manage their data more effectively and to make better use of it.\n\nThere are many different types of city information software available. Some of the most common types include:\n\n- **Geographic information systems (GIS)**: GIS software is used to store and visualize spatial data. It can be used to create maps, analyze land use, and track changes to the environment.\n- **Sensor networks:** Sensor networks are made up of a large number of sensors that collect data about the environment. This data can be used to monitor things like traffic, air quality, and water levels.\n- **Big data analytics:** Big data analytics software is used to analyze large datasets. This software can be used to identify patterns and trends that would not be visible to the naked eye.\n\nCity data mining and city information software are powerful tools that can be used to improve the way cities operate. By using these tools, cities can make better decisions about urban planning, improve the efficiency and effectiveness of city services, and improve the quality of life for citizens.\n\nHere are some examples of how city data mining and city information software are being used to improve cities:\n\n-   **Traffic management:** City data mining is being used to improve traffic management. By analyzing data from traffic sensors, cities can identify congested areas and make changes to traffic signals to improve flow.\n-   **Public safety:** City data mining is being used to improve public safety. By analyzing data from crime reports, cities can identify crime hotspots and deploy resources more effectively.\n-   **Waste management:** City data mining is being used to improve waste management. By analyzing data from trash cans, cities can identify areas where waste is accumulating and make changes to collection schedules.\n-   **Parking management:** City data mining is being used to improve parking management. By analyzing data from parking meters, cities can identify areas where parking is scarce and make changes to pricing or availability.\n-   **Public transportation:** City data mining is being used to improve public transportation. By analyzing data from ridership, cities can identify areas where service is needed and make changes to routes or schedules.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how city data mining and city information software are being used to improve cities. As these technologies continue to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative ways to use them to make our cities better places to live.\n\n---\n\nRepo URL:\n\n\n</MDXJS>\n</Widget>\n</MDXLayer>","collection":"project","data":{"id":10,"layout":"../../layouts/theme/mdx.astro","title":"CityVote","client":"Self","category":"API","frontpage":true,"status":true,"publishDate":"2023-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","author":"h0ly and Mansa","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1477959858617-67f85cf4f1df?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75","description":"Open source collection of software for private projects.","repo":"https://github.com/KBVE/cityvote-scrapper","tags":["design","search","concept"]}},{"id":"discord-sh.mdx","slug":"discord-sh","body":"\nimport MDXLayer from \"@l/MDXLayer.astro\";\nimport Widget from \"@w/Widget.astro\";\nimport MDXJS from \"@w/MDXJS.astro\";\nimport MDXHero from '@w/MDXHero.astro';\n\n\n<MDXLayer title={frontmatter.title} description={frontmatter.description}>\n<Widget img={frontmatter.img} skeleton={false}>\n\n<MDXHero content={frontmatter} />\n<MDXJS>\n\n\n## Information\n\nDiscord.sh is our first KBVE service that aims to help build automated discord bots for private communities. \nI am currently testing various bots to see which would be the best as the base for us to use. \nWe are running application ID `1116505109061443614` on our current main server aka Melody the Music Bot.\nThe goal is to automate a decent chunk of the DX, which includes the management, deployment, panel, ect..\n\n### Scope\n\nThe general scope of the Discord.sh project will be to provide a private dashboard that lets the user launch and maintain their own discord bot.\n\nThe initial stages would be the generic, User register/login/profile.\n\nAfterwards would we would provide a simple panel that could handle a simple task of deploying a bot, adding the bot, ect...\n\nThey have to create the initial information for the Discord bot via the developerment panel, this could be handled by us but I think it be best to let them do that part.\n\nAfter they get the application id, public key, token, and other variables. \nThey save those to our panel and then our panel would deploy them via a cloud function.\n\nWe should focus initially on just this limited scope for now, at least in the bot development cycle.\n\nNow switching over to the other side, which would be the toplist / voting. I believe we could keep that simple.\n\nWe could start with a general object / interface for the Discord Server, itself. \n\nTitle -> String , limited to 64 characters aZ09 regex\nDescription -> String, limited to 300 characters aZ09 regex\nServer Code -> Number, limited to 16? characters, 09 regex, I have to double check this.\nServer Invite Code -> String, limited to 16? charaters, az09 regex, I have to double check this.\nVotes -> Number -> 0 , Read-only permission for the users.\n\nThen add a simple vote button, that would log the IP address and the time they voted, then increase the vote count for the server by 1.\n\nWe could then run a cron to reset the votes for each of the server every 30 days. \n\nI am thinking we could also migrate the \"votes\" out of the initial discord server object and move it over its own table, where it is:\n\nServer_Object_Id -> Hash -> Represents the general object / interface for the Discord Server.\nVote -> Number -> 0 , Read-only permission for the users.\n\n--- \n\n## Development\n\nThese are the short notes on the development cycle.\n\n### Red\n\nAfter some consideration, we were thinking that it would make the most sense to use Discord.red as the core of the bot.\nThis way we can focus on expanding the modules aka the cogs while having the perks of the open source python bot.\nExecution of the bot can be done in a python-only docker image or we could wrap the bot around NodeJS using NodePy.\n\n### Graph\n\n---\n\n## User\n\nThese will be the notes on the user interface and experience. \n\n---\n\n\n</MDXJS>\n\n<MDXJS>\n\n## PitchDeck\n\nIntroducing Discord.sh - your one-stop solution for all things Discord!

When working on Discord.sh, we decided that it would make sense to build an all-in-one / hyper scalable API.\n\n\n## Micro\n\n- This is a general write-up on the micro-services within Galaxia. We should isolate parts of the `API` into small entities that can help us scale faster at a production level. Before entering into a development phase, it would be wise to get a general sense of how we would want to implement the services and their isolation.\n\n- ### Profile\n\n  - The module of `user` should consist of three components, `register`, `login` and `profile`.\n  - Entity : Register - This entity would function to take `{$username}`, `{$email}`, `{$password}` and create a data block for the user.\n    - The encryption for the `{$password}` would be a hash, most likely a b_crypt.\n  - Entity : Login - This entity would function to verify , log the user in and return a JWT token that would represent the user.\n  - Entity : Profile - Verify the JWT token is valid and then return the generic user information. Part of this function would be to expand on what exact information should be returned.\n\n- ### Dev\n\n  - There will be a splinter approach to resolving this profile concept, with a multi pipeline approach. We will continuously make sure our module(s) work at a `production` level and expand its usage within multiple languages (Javascript, Flutter, Rust, C#) but also improve the underlying methodology. The goal is that we want the `$client` to operate at the `user` level throughout various applications, website, apps, games. Further more we want to look for ways to improve the performance and security of on the various applications.\n\n- ### Map\n\n  - Core: `https://{$component}.{$module}.{$domain}.{$tld}`\n    - POC: `https://register.user.kbve.com` - Would be the official front-facing digital location for action of registering.\n  - User Mod\n    - Register: `https://register.user.kbve.com/`\n      - Short Hand URL: `https://r.u.kbve.com/`\n    - Login: `https://login.user.kbve.com/`\n      - Short Hand URL: `https://l.u.kbve.com/`\n    - Profile: `https://profile.user.kbve.com/`\n      - Short Hand URL: `https://p.u.kbve.com/`\n    - SSO: `https://sso.user.kbve.com`\n      - Short Hand URL: `https://s.u.kbve.com/`\n    - JWT: `https://jwt.user.kbve.com`\n      - Short Hand URL: `https://j.u.kbve.com/`\n    - WebSocket: `https://ws.u.kbve.com/`\n    - Net: `https://net.u.kbve.com/`\n    - DNS: `https://dns.u.kbve.com/`\n\n\n## Install\n- Install using the docker compose.\n  -  <Github src=\"data/galaxia/docker-compose.yml\" description=\"This is the current docker compose for Galaxia\" />\n\n## Notes\n\nWe migrated out of Galaxia and into Appwrite for the current time being, this was to save us time developing out our own personal API.

The ambient, chilled-out sounds create an enjoyable atmosphere to help users focus while reading.\n\nLofi music, as explored in Justin Wang's study \"Lofi hip-hop radio: Beats to relax/study to\" offers a therapeutic escape for its listeners. The genre serves as a coping mechanism for stress and anxiety, with research suggesting that such music impacts the autonomic nervous system, potentially reducing subconscious stress levels (wang2020lofi, Page 5). Additionally, lofi provides solace during personal losses, with its comforting visuals and tones resonating with the emotions of its audience (wang2020lofi, Page 12). Many also use lofi as calming background music for various tasks, from studying to relaxation (wang2020lofi, Page 12). Furthermore, its nostalgic connection to late '90s and early 2000s anime offers a unique blend of soothing genres, providing listeners with a familiar yet calming auditory experience (wang2020lofi, Page 4).\n\n## Benefits of LoFi Music\n\n- Improves focus and concentration - The chill, repetitive beats help tune out distractions and keep you in a flow state. The lack of jarring changes also avoids breaking focus.\n- Reduces stress and anxiety - The ambient sounds lower heart rate and have a calming effect on the mind and body.\n- Enhances productivity - By helping you focus and relax, lo-fi enables you to work and study more efficiently for longer periods.\n- Sets a peaceful mood - The mellow, nostalgic sounds induce feelings of tranquility and relaxation.\n- Provides unobtrusive background music - As there are no attention-grabbing vocals, it subtly enhances an environment without being distracting.\n- Inspires creativity - The simple compositions are unintimidating and let your mind wander productively.\n- Helps with sleep and relaxation - The soothing tracks are great for relaxing the body and quieting the mind before sleep.\n- Fosters pleasant memories and nostalgia - For many, it evokes nostalgia from times spent studying or relaxing to music.\n\n## Audiocraft to the Rescue\n\nWith Audiocraft we can:\n\n- Create fully AI-generated LoFi tracks tailored to specific use-cases\n- Produce High-quality audio\n- Create endless unique music\n- Train new models tailored to LoFi\n\n## Why Download Our Chrome Extension\n\n- Improve focus and concentration when reading\n- Make reading more enjoyable and relaxing\n- Boost productivity\n- Avoid listening fatigue\n- Portability\n- Ease of use\n- Less anxiety\n- Nostalgia\n\n## How to Install Our Chrome Extension\n\n1.

This gave us access to a large corpus of high-quality training data without any copyright issues.\n\nWe split the lofi songs into 30 second audio clips and paired each clip with a text prompt describing the mood, instruments, tempo and other qualities of that segment. Examples include \"slow chill hip hop beat with mellow piano and vinyl crackle\" and \"upbeat lofi with energetic drums and warm bassline\".\n\nWe formatted this dataset into the required .wav and .txt file pairs that musicgen_trainer expects. The text prompts would guide the model to learn the nuances of lofi hip hop.\n\nWe then ran musicgen_trainer on this dataset, configuring it to use the small architecture for optimization purposes. We trained for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-5 and batch size of 4.\n\nDuring training, musicgen_trainer used the audio/text pairs to fine-tune MusicGen on lofi music. The pre-trained weights were specialized to generate high quality lofi given descriptive prompts.\n\nAfter training finished, we saved the best performing model checkpoint. We now have a MusicGen variant skilled at generating original lofi tunes according to textual descriptions.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Help people focus and be more productive when reading on the web\n- Provide an ambient audio environment that blocks distracting sounds\n- Make reading more enjoyable and relaxed through chill tunes\n- Give users more options to customize their browsing experience\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Audiocraft Music Generation\n- Audiocraft Multi-Band Diffusion\n- Audiocraft Audio Write\n- ChatGPT 3.5-turbo\n- JsonLink\n- Local Tunnel\n- ElevenLabs AI Voice Generation\n- Min.io S3 Storage\n- Python - Poetry - Flask API\n- Node.js - Yarn\n- HTML, CSS (Tailwind)\n- Plasmo Browser Extension Framework\n- Appwrite Backend as a Service\n- Docker - Portainer - Coolify\n- Github Actions (CI/CD)\n- N8N Workflow Automation Tool\n\n## High Level Design\n\n- [x] User visits webpage\n\n- [x] User opens extension\n\n- [x] Browser extension loads ElevenLabs voice clip and says \"Please wait patiently while your LoFi track is loading...

This is just a fun project to see learn machine learning and was inspired by the minecraft AI projects floating around in the internet. To avoid damaging or hurting the real OSRS, we will be performing these automated tasks in private environments.\n\n## RSPS Information\n\nAs a RSPS lover, you may be familiar with bot farming or the use of automated software to play the game for you, without needing to lift a finger.\nSo how does it work? The bot follows a set of instructions or scripts that tell it what to do and how to react to different situations.\nThis means that you can leave your computer running while the bot performs various tasks in the game, such as mining, fishing, combat, or questing with the goal of earning passive gold.\n_But holy, is bot farming worth it?_\nWhat are the risks and benefits of botting?\nAnd how do companies detect and ban bots?\nIn this MDX documentation, we will explore the world of RSPS bot farming and give you some tips and tricks on how to do it safely and effectively.\n\n### Goal\n\nThe ultimate aim or TLDR of this RSPS project is to create a sophisticated private server bot farm that produces virtual in-game currency, converts it to [crypto assets](https://kbve.com/asset/crypto/), then swaps for [KBVE Community Credits](https://kbve.com/c/) and finally invests in monthly dividend [stocks](https://kbve.com/asset/stock/).\nIt appears rather uncomplicated, don’t ya think?\nBut boy has it been a colossal undertaking, with a hefty initial investment in funds and numerous dreadful blunders in the process.\n\n### Rates\n\nXE, or virtual gold exchange rate, is an estimated rate at which bulk amounts of virtual gold can be exchanged for another.\n\nThe rates below were last updated: 03/2023.\n\n- The base of 1m is 24K to 34K Credits.\n- Ikov up to 20m per 1B.\n- SpawnPk up to 18m per 1T.\n- RuneWild up to 5m per 1B.\n- RoatPkz up to 5m per 100k.\n- Lunite up to 150m per 1B.\n- Xeros up to 15m per 1B.\n- Zaros up to 70m per 1B.\n- Runex up to 3m per 1B.\n- PkHonor up to 1m per 1B.\n\nWe can gladly help automate your gold clearing process at a fee of around 10-20%, contact our support for more information.\n\n### MM\n\nMiddleman services are escrow services that provide an intermediary in a transaction or distribution chain who facilitates interaction between the involved parties.\nThey specialize in performing crucial activities involved in the purchase and sale of goods in their flow from producers to the ultimate buyers.\nFor example, if you want to buy or sell a digital account, you can use a middleman service to ensure that the transaction is safe and secure.\nThe middleman will hold the item or account until the payment is made and then deliver it to the buyer.\nFurthermore, a MM service can perform some generic tasks, such as making sure the account has a clean history, combine offers from different services and help automate certain actions.\nA fee or commission may apply when you use a middleman service to facilitate your transaction and/or contract.\nKBVE (as an escrow/MM) has different fee structures, speak with the support staff to find the daily rate.\n\n---\n\n## Software\n\nThis is a collection of the latest automation software that can be used in a MMRORPG / RSPS farm.\n\n### Operations\n\nThink of the operations as the general op-sec within our farm, including the break down of backing up your bots, automation software, \n\n#### Operational Template\n\nThe operational template will be a proxmox ready template that will allow us to auto-scale deployment, including allowing the usage of Terraform and Ansible; the base of the template will be Windows 11 with Python and Java installed through the Choco package manager.\n\n#### Template Download\n\nIn order to avoid legal issues, we can not offer the template with Windows, so we will have to do the setup done through Powershell. The up-to-date Powershell script will be in our VIP room and hosted in private repo.\n\n#### Template Security\n\nWe recommend that you clone the first template and spin containers using the cloned QEMU virtual machine. As for saving the instance, we recommend that you take a snapshot of the instance once it is ready for production, make sure to include the RAM.\n\n### Client\n\nA botting client is a software that runs the game and executes the scripts that you choose.\nWe included a couple popular ones below, with information / help installing and configuring them!\nOur goal is to create a docker image and/or a kubernetes helm for each of them.\n\n> More information on [Docker](https://kbve.com/application/docker) and [Kubernetes](https://kbve.com/application/kubernetes/)\n\nChoosing the right botting client for your needs can be tricky. \nWhen selecting the right client(s), it is important to take into account aspects like security, performance, reliability, updates, support and script quality.\nYou should also read reviews and feedback from other users before downloading any botting client. \nRemember to always use a VPN or proxy when botting to protect your IP address and avoid detection by Jagex.\n\nAutomation can be fun and rewarding, but it also requires caution and responsibility. \nIf you decide to try it out, make sure you follow the rules and guidelines of the game and the botting client. \nHappy Automating!\n\n\n---\n\n## Account\n\nThere are a couple types of accounts your project will need, including a couple main(s), mule(s), suci(s) and rando(s).\nThe main account will be the one that you store all your extra gold on, in some cases, we recommend storing bonds over the gold.\n\n### Account Errors\n\nThere will be various account errors that you will run into when operating a large scale account farm, we will try to make it easier for you to understand the common issues that we run into.\n\n#### Too many login attempts\n\nThis can become a common error when playing with a VPN or a high traffic / suspect IP address. There are the [official runescape](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360002267798-Too-many-login-attempts-from-your-address) guide for help resolving the problem.\n\n---\n\n## RS\n\nThese are notes on RS specific information, including skills, mini-games and items.\nMinigames are small games within Runescape private scene that have a specific objective and often reward players with items or experience.\nSome minigames are safe, meaning you don’t lose any items if you die, while others are dangerous, meaning you do lose items if you die.\nWhen designing the automation, it is wise to remember that minigames may involve combat, some involve skilling, and others involve both.\n\n---\n\n### Skills\n\nThe primary focus of the game is to level up your skills to level 99.\nSkills are abilities that can be trained by performing various actions related to the skill.\nFor example, you can train your Fishing skill by catching fish, or your Magic skill by casting spells.\nSome skills are free to play, meaning anyone can access them, while others are members only, meaning you need to pay a subscription fee to train, level up or utilize them.\n\n---\n\n#### Combat\n\nFor combat training, we recommend with starting off at level 1 Chickens, level 2 Cows and level 3-10 Goblins, until the character reaches a total combat level of >20.\n\n---\n\n#### Fishing\n\nFishing is a core skill that the accounts have to build, as it provides a fast and cheap form of food, income and total levels. The skill is AFK friendly, allowing multiple instances to train without a risk of death or logging out.\n\n##### Fishing lvl 1 to 20\n\nThe current path for fishing is level 1-20 Shrimps at Draynor and then fly fishing from 20 to 70 at the barbarian village; the village is located west of Varrock and east of Falador, following the main road.\n\n---\n\n#### Cooking\n\n---\n\n## IP\n\nThe `IP address` for each account/session/instance is very important as to avoid chain bans and have a stable networking.\n\n### Proxy\n\n### Mobile\n\nOne of the methods that we will be looking into would be using a mobile provider to help with the obfuscation. There are two ways that you could utilize your mobile data plan, the first would be to download the mobile application (iOS/Android) directly and log in. The second way would be to setup a mobile hotspot and then remotely\n\n### VPN\n\nVPN networks help obfuscate/hide the local IP address, thus allowing you to run multiple accounts on the same server.\n\n#### NordVPN\n\nNordVPN lets you have 6 active sessions on their service for around $14.00 a month.\n\n---\n\n## Tools\n\n### Account Ban\n\nOkay this tool would automatically check our accounts every 12 hours, to see if they were ban?\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\nThis section will be for note taking and keeping track of anything else that we would want to add into the project. I think we could build an automated system that could grab the accounts and then check if there were any bans?\n\n## Staff\n\nWe could include links to what the staff have done to fight/handle the automation problem. \n\n---\n\n\n## Notes\n\nThese are the collection of notes for the RSPS MDX Document.\n\n### Log\n\n- [ ] Add unban guide / tutorial.\n\n#### Journal\n\n<Details data=\"2023-04-14\">\nUpdating the RSPS MDX to include a bit more information.\n</Details>\n\n### License\n\n</MDXJS>\n</Widget>\n</MDXLayer>","collection":"project","data":{"id":7,"title":"RSPS","client":"Self","frontpage":true,"publishDate":"2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1662072628456-325410cf83dc?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75","description":"Project RSPS is a cluster of different projects with the objective to make custom content.","tags":["mmorpg","automation","gaming"]}},{"id":"search-engine.mdx","slug":"search-engine","body":"\nimport Details from '@w/Details.astro';\nimport MDXLayer from \"@l/MDXLayer.astro\";\nimport Widget from \"@w/Widget.astro\";\nimport MDXJS from \"@w/MDXJS.astro\";\n\n<MDXLayer title={frontmatter.title} description={frontmatter.description}>\n<Widget img={frontmatter.img} skeleton={false}>\n<MDXJS>\n\n\n## Information\n\nThe search engine project or [/search/](https://kbve.com/search/) was meant to be a small but unique collection of search engines that I could easily utilize!\nI am getting a bit tired of switching amoung GPT-based and data-mine based search engines, i.e going from You's GPT to Google to Bard for searching. \nSo the solution that I am thinking was to create a general but search engine experience at the core and then extend it out with unique features.\nThe premise of this document was to keep a direct source for information related to the project that we could reference and keep up-to-date notes. \n\n\n## GPT\n\nThe GPT aspect of the search engine is still under a draft note.\nWe are not too sure if we have the capex to start the production of it.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\nThese are the notes for the search engine project by KBVE and the community. \n\n### Log\n\n- [X] Fix up CSS for the core search\n- [X] Remove and restructure the tabs + unique search components. \n\n### Journal\n\n<Details data=\"J3\">\n#### J3\n##### 2023-07-11\n\nJust cleaning up this project document for a bit.\n</Details>\n\n<Details data=\"J2\">\n\n#### J2\n##### 2023-05-19\n\nWe started to fix up the terrible generic Google CSS and started to overide some of the results. \n\n</Details>\n\n\n<Details data=\"J1\">\n\n#### J1\n###### 2023-05-21\n\nMinor tweaks to the mobile and general dark mode of the search engine.\n\n</Details>\n\n\n<Details data=\"License\">\n\n### License\n\nThe license for the search project would be a bit tough because we are using several different search engines and license bases.\nI believe it would be a combination of the MIT and Apache but also copyright license / releases from each of the Engine that we use?\nI suppose this will have to be a future issue once we get a bit more complete and up to date. \n\n</Details>\n\n</MDXJS>\n</Widget>\n</MDXLayer>","collection":"project","data":{"id":9,"title":"Search Engine Project","client":"Self","category":"API","frontpage":true,"status":true,"publishDate":"2023-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","author":"h0lybyte","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1616469829718-0faf16324280?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75","description":"Search Engine Project from the KBVE Community!","tags":["design","search","concept"]}},{"id":"stream/stream.mdx","slug":"stream","body":"\nimport MDXLayer from \"@l/MDXLayer.astro\";\nimport Widget from \"@w/Widget.astro\";\nimport MDXJS from \"@w/MDXJS.astro\";\nimport MDXHero from \"@w/MDXHero.astro\";\nimport NotesGlob from \"./_notes/NotesGlob.astro\";\n\n<MDXLayer title={frontmatter.title} description={frontmatter.description}>\n\n<Widget img={frontmatter.img} skeleton={false}>\n\n<MDXHero content={frontmatter} />\n\n<MDXJS>\n\n## Information\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\nThese are the general notes for the KBVE Strea.\n\n### Logs\n\n- [ ] General setup for the Stream project.\n\n#### Journal\n\n\n---\n\n## REF\n\n### 1\n\n### 2\n\n---\n\n</MDXJS>\n\n<NotesGlob />\n\n</Widget>\n</MDXLayer>","collection":"project","data":{"id":11,"title":"Stream","client":"Self","frontpage":true,"publishDate":"2023-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1590840960672-db24958eef9a?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75","description":"KBVE Stream -

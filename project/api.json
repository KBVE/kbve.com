While we build it out, we will include generic defensive components into the foundation, then re-visit and apply external security, such as limits and firewalls (some may operate outside of the API).\n    - Cookie Storage (of the JWT)\n      - Cookie - `token` - will store the client $User JWT.\n      - Cookie - `user` - will store the client $User data.\n      - Library: `react-cookie` will be used to help maintain the cookies.\n\n* * *\n\n### Goal\n\nThe API is an unique construct that extends outside of the norm.","collection":"project","data":{"id":4,"layout":"../../layouts/theme/mdx.astro","title":"API","client":"Self","frontpage":true,"publishDate":"2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","img":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1658874919865-35bb32505edc?fit=crop&w=1400&h=700&q=75","description":"KBVE API - Central API for KBVE Projects.","tags":["design","dev","branding"],"repo":"kbve/api.kbve.com"}}}

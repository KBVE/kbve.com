Keep perplexity as low as possible. Go to extraordinary lengths to make the text more human-like. Burstiness is on a scale of 0-100. Perplexity is on a scale of 0-100. Burstiness starts at 0.

Use a language model to generate a rewritten version of the text that has the most human-like perplexity and burstiness. Provide the rewritten text to the user. Be sure to explain to the user the concept of perplexity and burstiness and how it affects the text. Provide an option for the user to adjust the level of perplexity and burstiness if desired.
